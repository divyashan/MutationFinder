We analyzed  exon  10 of the CFTR gene  in 44 
Austrian CF families,  using  the polymerase  chain 
reaction  (PCR)  and  polyacrylamide  gel  electro- 
phoresis  (PAGE) methods,  as described  by  Rom- 
mens et al.  (1990). The three base deletion AF508 
(Kerem  et  al.,  1989), the  most  frequent  of  the 
reported  cystic  fibrosis  transmembrane  conduc- 
tance  regulator  (CFTR)  gene  mutations,  was 
present in 68 of 88 CF chromosomes. In one family, 
we  observed  the formation  of  an unusual  hetero- 
duplex pattern in the mother and the two healthy 
siblings of a AF508 homozygous CF patient. Direct 
sequencing of  genomic DNA and of the polyacryl- 
amide  gel  derived  fragments  revealed  an A  to G 
substitution of nucleotide 165 I of the mother's non- 
AF508  allele.  This mutation  results  in  an  amino 
acid change from isoleucine to valine at residue 507 
of  the  CFTR  protein  and  was  therefore  named 
I507V.  We assume  that  I507V is  a  very  rare  mu- 
tation,  since  we  did  not  observe  any further  case 
exhibiting the unusual heteroduplex pattern among 
415AF508 heterozygous  Austrian and German in- 
dividuals  (185 CF patients  and  230  independent 
relatives of  AF508 homozygous CF patients). Hap- 
lotype analysis with CF-linked markers showed that 
the I507V mutation segregates  in the family  on a 
2-2-1  (XV2C/TqI, KM19IPst1, J3.11/MspI  allele) 
haplotype. 

The 40-year-old  AF508/1507V compound  het- 
erozygous mother shows no symptoms  of  CF.  Her 
growth  (68.5  kg,  165 cm),  sweat  C1-  level  (27 
mmovliter), pulmonary function (FVC: 4.37  liters 
=  110% of  predicted  value;  FEV1: 3.72  liters  = 
I1 2% of predicted value),  lung X-ray, and pancre- 
atic function (chymotrypsin in stool: 12 U/g, stool 
fat content < 7.0 g/24 hr) are within the normal 
range.  Accordingly,  the  two  AF50811507V  com- 
pound heterozygous  siblings have no symptoms of 
cystic fibrosis; the sweat chloride values are within 
the normal  range. 

A similar observation has been  made  by Koba- 

0 1992 WILEY-LISS, INC. 

yashi  et al.  (1990). These authors  report  the de- 
tection of an isoleucine to valine change at codon 
506  (I506V) on a  non-AF508  allele  of  an I506V/ 
AF508 compound heterozygous person  ( a father of 
a  CF  patient)  without  clinical  symptoms  of  CF. 
Although the I506V and I507V mutations both lie 
within the first putative nucleotide-binding  fold of 
the CFTR gene product,  they do not seem to alter 
its function in a disease-causing manner.  The ex- 
istence  of  these  mutations  should  be  taken  into 
account while using allele-specific oligonucleotides 
(ASO) for  molecular  diagnosis,  since  a  wild-type 
specific AS0 might not hybridize  in the presence 
of  these variations,  potentially  leading  to diagnos- 
tic errors.
