Recently, the REP-1 gene was isolated and the causative mutations in the gene were detected in patients with CHM. In a previous study, we described a Japanese family with CHM who had a mutation in the REP-1 gene. In the present study, we performed extensive analysis of the REP-1 gene in patients with CHM from several institutions in Japan. l Methods: Twenty-six patients with CHM and 5 unaffected females from 22 independently ascertained families were examined. Exons 115 of the REP-1 gene were screened by single- strand conformation polymorphism. The DNA fragments suspected of any variations were directly sequenced. l Results: Fifteen different muta- tions, including one previously re- ported mutation, were detected in 18 families. In addition, carrier status was proven in four unaffected fe- males found to be heterozygous for the mutant allele. l Conclusions: Fifteen different mu- tations of the REP-1 gene were de- tected in 18 Japanese families. There were no hot spots for the mutations and no missense mutations. The re-  736  Introduction  Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked recessive eye dis- order characterized by progressive degeneration of the choroid, retinal pigment epithelium, and retina. Affected males develop night-blindness in the teenage years, fol- lowed by visual field constriction and severe visual im- pairment by the fourth to fifth decade of life. Female car- riers are generally asymptomatic but can be diagnosed by characteristic pigment abnormalities in the ocular fundus.  A part of the CHM gene was isolated by positional cloning [5, 8]. Recently, the complete protein-coding re- gion of the gene was isolated, and the genes exon-intron structure was determined [18]. The CHM gene encodes a protein of 653 amino acids. The open reading frame of the CHM gene consists of 15 exons spanning approximately 150 Kb of Xq21.2. The products of component A of the  rat Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (GGTase) were found to be identical with the human gene product [15]. Thus, the CHM gene is referred to as the human Rab escort pro- tein-1 (REP-1) gene [1]. Point mutations and insertions/ deletions in the REP-1 gene have been identified in Euro- pean [2, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19], Canadian [9], and American families [6]. Earlier, we reported a hemizygous mutation in a Japanese patient with CHM and his heterozygous mother [7].  We present here 15 different mutations in the REP-1 gene found in Japanese patients with CHM from several different institutions in Japan. Thirteen of the 15 muta- tions were different from the mutations in the European, Canadian, and American CHM patients, and we suggest that the mutations in the Japanese population occurred in- dependently.

Fourteen (63.6%) of the families showed a typical X-linked recessive inheritance pat- tern by family history or by having a clinically identified female car- rier. One of the other cases had an affected brother, and the remain- ing seven families were isolated cases. Unrelated normal volunteers consisting of 9 women and 14 men were also examined.  Peripheral blood samples were collected from the patients and the unaffected women from the families with CHM and from the 23 unrelated normal volunteers. Appropriate informed consent was obtained from each individual. Genomic DNAs were extracted from leukocytes using a standard procedure [3]. Exons 115 of the REP-1 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a pair of primers for each exon and the annealing temperature as pre- viously reported [18]. PCR was carried out in a volume of 50 (cid:31)l in a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin Elmer, USA). The PCR products were screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) [10]. The 35 (cid:31)l aliquots of the PCR products were subsequently diluted with an equal volume of 95% formamide containing 20 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), 0.05% bromophenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol, and 10 mM NaOH and denatured at 95(cid:30)C for 15 20 min. The samples then underwent electrophoresis in nondenatur- ing 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 10% glycerol. Electrophore- sis was performed at 4(cid:30)C at a constant voltage of 300 V for 45 h using 1(cid:148)TBE (Tris-borate/EDTA electrophoresis buffer). After elec- trophoresis, the DNA bands were stained by silver stain (PlusOne, Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden). DNA fragments suspected of any vari- ations were directly sequenced.  The PCR products were purified with a High Pure PCR product Purification Kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) and subjected to a dideoxy chain termination method [12, 16] using the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Core Kit (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems, USA). They were then sequenced using an automated sequencer (model 373A; Applied Biosystems, USA). The sequences for the coding regions were compared with the nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences of REP-1 cDNA [18]. The DNA fragments that showed no band shift by SSCP in any exons were di- rectly sequenced for all exons.  tions were comparable, e.g., deletions, insertions, point mutations at splice junction signal, and nonsense muta- tions, to those reported in the European [2, 14, 17, 19], Canadian [9], and American [6] patients, the 15 mutations detected in Japanese patients differed in the position of the mutations except for the mutations of R267X and 1313delTC. Therefore, the mutations of the REP-1 gene most likely occurred independently in the Japanese fami- lies. Mutations occurred in almost all exons. There were no hot spots for the mutations and no missense mutations. All of the patients had either nonsense, frameshift, or splice errors. These mutations are expected to result in an absent or truncated and thus nonfunctional REP-1 gene product.  Although eight deletions (8/69, 11.6%) in 69 CHM pa- tients in Europe have been identified, where the deletions are heterogeneous in both size and location [4], in the present study only one case (1/22, 4.5%) was suspected to be a deletion of exon 1 to 12.  In approximately one-third of European CHM patients screened for the coding regions in the REP-1 gene, the causative mutation has not been identified [19]. In the present study, we also could not detect any causative mu- tation in the coding region of five patients from three fam- ilies (3/22, 13.6%). Three of these patients were maternal cousins, another has a clinically confirmed carrier sister, and the last was an isolated case. These patients probably have a defect in a part of the REP-1 gene other than the coding region, have genetic heterogeneity caused by an- other gene, or clinical assessment of the patient may have been poor. The findings may also indicate that a higher proportion of CHM patients in Japan are affected by REP-1 gene mutations. Further studies will have to be un- dertaken.  Results  Fifteen different mutations were detected in the 21 pa- tients and 5 unaffected women from 18 families, includ- ing a family reported previously [7] (Table 1). Figure 1 shows a part of the migration differences by SSCP anal- ysis. Figure 2 shows the nucleotide sequencing around the nucleotide position (nt) of the mutation in each exon. A probable large deletion of the REP-1 gene was sus- pected in one patient because DNA fragments could not be amplified except for exons 1315 (data not shown). No mutation was detected in five patients from three families in spite of the repeated SSCP and sequenc- ing. Mutations were not detected in any of the 23 normal volunteers.

12203991	HUMAN MUTATION 20:189^196 (2002)  RESEARCH ARTICLE  Mutational Analysis of Patients With the Diagnosis of Choroideremia  Kerry E. McTaggart, Mai Tran, Dean Y. Mah, Sarah W. Lai, Nancy J. Nesslinger, and Ian M. MacDonaldn Ocular Genetics Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada  Communicated by Andreas Gal  All reported mutations in the choroideremia (CHM) gene result in the truncation or complete absence of Rab escort protein 1 (REP1). Molecular analysis was carried out on 57 families diagnosed with CHM. Confirmation of the clinical diagnosis is important as end-stage CHM may be clinically similar to the end stages of other retinal degenerative diseases such as RP. The primary means of confirming the diagnosis of CHM is to sequence all 15 exons. An alternative method involves detection of the REP1 protein, as described in MacDonald et al. [1998]. A monoclonal antibody to REP1 does not detect truncated REP1 by immunoblot analysis, presumably due to instability and subsequent degradation of the truncated protein. This analysis provides relatively fast confirmation of the diagnosis, however, protein samples are not always available and are susceptible to degradation, affecting the accurate interpretation of results. CHM gene mutations were found in 54 of 57 families studied. The majority of mutations (442%) were transitions and transversions. Complete deletions of the CHM gene and deletion/insertion mutations each accounted for almost 4% of the total, while over 9% had large intragenic and other partial deletions. Almost 28% of the mutations were deletions of fewer than 5 base pairs (bp) and almost 13% were splice site mutations. Despite the fact that mutations are found throughout the gene with no common mutation for the disorder, identical mutations have been characterized in unrelated individuals. The majority of these mutations are C to T transitions, changing an arginine residue (CGA) to a stop codon (TGA). Four of the five CGA codons in the CHM gene are sites of recurring mutations.

Affected males have fundus signs in early childhood, but may not seek care until they experience night blindness teenage years. Affected males experience progressive loss of peripheral vision and then central vision once the macula becomes involved. Carrier females may be diagnosed clinically as fundus examinations show patchy areas of chorior- etinal atrophy [MacDonald, 1998]. This atrophy is progressive because CHM is a biochemical disorder and the patchiness is a result of Lyonization and clonal derivation from a single cell that does not produce the normal gene product.  rr2002 WILEY-LISS, INC.

Failure of the REP1 monoclonal antibody, 2F1, to detect truncated proteins enables immunoblot analysis to confirm the clinical diagnosis of CHM in affected males [MacDonald et al., 1998]. Following protein analysis, molecular analysis of the CHM gene by sequencing is performed to define the mutation. Clinically, the end stage of CHM resembles the end stages of other retinal degenerative diseases and thus confirmation of the diagnosis is important.

Immunoblot analysis is particularly useful in those individuals for whom no mutation in the gene can be defined by sequencing.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Patients  Informed consent was obtained from patients participating in this study. The research protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Alberta and followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki as it applies to patients.  Mutational Analysis  DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples or lymphoblastoid cell lines using standard organic extraction procedures. PCR-SSCP analysis was performed as previously described [MacDonald et al., 1998]. Fragments with possible exon shifts revealed by SSCP were amplified by PCR and subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. Fragments were excised and then purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Manual sequen-  cing was performed using the Thermo Sequenase 33P-ddNTP kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie dUrfe, Quebec Canada).  The primers used in the mutation analyses were synthesized by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) and Canadian Life Technologies (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Sequences of primers amplifying exons 1 to 15 of the CHM gene were from van Bokhoven et al. [1994a]. Some modifications were made to the annealing temperatures. Primers WI-11849 (Genbank ID# R25163), pJ7.6B [van Bokhoven et al., 1994a], and CHM 50-1kb, -10kb, -18kb, -25kb, and -57kb (Table 1) flank the CHM gene and were used to determine the extent of deletions in Families 1, 23, 44, 50, and 68. PCR products amplified from these primers were sequenced to confirm amplification of the correct sequence.  RNA Analysis  Total RNA was extracted from lymphocytes or lymphoblas- toid cells using TRIzolt reagent (GIBCO BRL, Life Technol- ogies, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) in accordance with the manufacturers protocol. Total RNA was incubated with 10U of DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim, Roche Molecular Biochem- icals, Laval, Quebec, Canada) for 1 hr at 371C. First strand synthesis was performed with oligo dT primers and 200U of Superscript I (GIBCO BRL, Life Technologies, Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Second strand synthesis utilized specific primers (Table 1). Families 13 and 45 were analyzed using primers PTT2c/2d and PTT2a/2d, respectively [Beaufre`re et al., 1997], and Family 10 utilized primers 281/1346 and 281/1385 (Table 1). PCR products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, excised, and sequenced.  Polymorphism Analysis  DNA from individuals possessing the same mutation were screened using three intragenic polymorphisms. A single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 5 described by Nesslinger et al. [1996], was examined by sequencing or RFLP analysis. The restriction enzyme ApaLI (NEB, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), was used to digest exon 5 PCR products for the RFLP analysis.

Primers were synthesized by Canadian Life Technologies (Burlington, Ontario, Canada).  Protein Extraction  Protein extraction was performed as previously described [MacDonald et al., 1998]. Leukocytes were primarily used to prepare protein, although lymphoblastoid cells were also used. Briefly, leukocyte or lymphoblastoid cell pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered solution and then lysed at 41C in a cocktail containing 50 mmol HEPES (pH 7.2), 10 mmol sodium chloride, 1 mmol dithiothreitol, 1 mmol Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (aprotinin 5 mg/ml, pepstatin A 5 mg/ml, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 0.5 mmol). The supernatant protein was collected following centrifugation at 100,000 g at 41C [MacDonald et al., 1998].  leupeptin 5 mg/ml,  Immunoblot Analysis  Immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described with the exception that the final detection was performed with Super-Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, MJS Biolynx Inc., Brockville, Ontario, Canada) and visualized after a brief exposure to Kodak Biomax MR or X-OMAT AR autoradiographic film [MacDonald et al., 1998].  Several controls were included in each experiment. Rat recombinant REP1 served as a positive control, as did a lymphoblastoid cell line prepared from a female patient. A cell line from an affected male served as a negative control. An antibody to the alpha subunit of farnesyl transferase (FTase), a cytosolic enzyme, served as an internal control to confirm the presence of an adequate amount of nondegraded protein. Both primary antibodies, 2F1(against REP1) and 1B7 (against FTase), were monoclonal. Unambiguous results were obtained a minimum of two times for each individual tested before scoring for the presence or absence of the REP1 protein.  Immunoblot Analysis  RESULTS  Immunoblot analysis was performed for 37 of the 57 families (Table 2). Inconclusive results were obtained for 15 of the 37 families due to degradation or insufficient protein to confirm the initial results. Affected members of the remaining 22 families, with the exception of Family 28, were REP1 negative, thus confirming the clinical diagnosis of CHM. Typical results for an affected male and a carrier female are shown in Figure 1A. Immunoblot results from the affected male of Family 28, shown in Figure 1B, suggested the presence of REP1, however, subsequent molecular analysis revealed a frameshift mutation in exon 5, resulting in truncation of the protein. The mother of the affected male was not a carrier by molecular analysis, which was consistent with her examination (Dr. R.A. Lewis, personal clinical communication). to resolve the discrepancy between molecular and immunoblot results, another peripheral blood sample was analyzed. Molecular analysis confirmed the presence of the mutation, however, immunoblot analysis was incon- clusive.  In an attempt  CHM MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS  191  Mutation Analysis  For many of the families, several members were available for testing. Carrier status determined by mutation analysis concurred with clinical observations (data not shown). PCR-SSCP analysis of all 15 exons of the CHM gene was carried out on members from 18 families (data not shown). Conformational shifts were detected in 16 of the families, and subsequent DNA sequencing of PCR products confirmed the presence of mutations. For the remaining two families (16 and 18), all 15 exons of the gene were sequenced, but no mutations were found. The clinical diagnosis of affected members of these two families was supported by immunoblot analysis (REP1 negative). Another REP1 negative family (57) did not have a mutation by DNA sequencing. PCR-SSCP analysis was not performed in this case.  insertions and deletions,  A variety of mutations were characterized by DNA sequencing. All of the identified point mutations and small resulted in the premature truncation of REP1. The 12 different transitions and transversions resulted in the produc- tion of a stop codon. Four of the mutations (R239X, R253X, R267X, R270X) were observed in more than one family. Self-reported family histories do not state the existence of other affected family members, however, this does not rule out the possibility of a common ancestor. Thus, we used several intragenic polymorphisms, including a single nucleotide poly- morphism in exon 5 [Nesslinger et al., 1996], a dinucleotide repeat polymorphism located in intron 14 [van Bokhoven et al., 1994b], and a polymorphic microsatellite marker located in intron 9 [van Bokhoven et al., 1996].  Four of the eight families possessing the R253X mutation shared the most common alleles for all three intragenic polymorphisms. Of the remaining four families, two possessed unique alleles for the intron 9 microsatellite, and the other two shared alleles distinct from the others, however, they could not be differentiated from each other (data not shown). Thus, for some of these families, the possibility of a common ancestor cannot be ruled out. The two families with the R239X mutation were differentiated by the intron 9 microsatellite, as were the two families with the R270X mutation. Of the three families with the R267X mutation, Family 122 possessed an allele unique from the intron 9 microsatellite alleles of Families 2 and 26. Families 2 and 26 did not share alleles for the intron 14 dinucleotide polymorphism (data not shown).  The 13 different small  insertions and deletions caused frameshift mutations, resulting in the produc- tion of a stop codon downstream of the alteration. Three of these were characterized in more than one of our families in the present study but they could all be differentiated by polymorphic markers (data not shown).  192  McTAGGART ET AL.

An FIGURE 1. antibody to REP-1 (2F1) was used to test for the presence or absence of the CHM gene product. Detection of FTase was used as an internal control to verify the quantity and integrity of the protein samples.The lanes marked REP-1 contained puried rat recombinant REP-1, which migrates more slowly than human REP-1. A:The positive (  ) control protein sample was isolated from a lymphoblastoid cell line of a carrier female from Family 9.The two remaining protein samples were extracted from leu- kocytes isolated from peripheral blood samples. AM11=aected male from Family 11. CF11=carrier female from Family 11. B: The positive (  ) and negative () control protein samples were isolated from lymphoblastoid cell lines of a carrier female from Family 13, and an aected male from Family 9, respectively. All other protein samples were extracted from leukocytes isolated from peripheral blood samples. AM28=aected male from Family 28. UAM28=unaected male from Family 28. FTase is ab- sent in this sample and thus the REP-1 results must be deemed inconclusive. CF=carrier female (mother of a proband not re- ported in this study). UAM=unaected male (initially diagnosed with CHM but subsequently changed to CSNB type 2). A smaller quantity of recombinant REP-1 was loaded in thisWestern.  The most interesting frameshift mutation was a deletion/insertion mutation in Family 35, in which 9 bp were deleted and replaced by 8 bp of unrelated sequence. The mother, aunt, cousin, and uncle of the proband possessed this mutation, consistent with their clinical diagnoses as either carriers or individuals with CHM.  Exon 1 and upstream anomalies. In two patients (Families 1 and 23), exon 1 consistently failed to amplify by PCR. No conformational shifts were observed in exons 2 through 15 by PCR-SSCP analysis. Primer pairs located in upstream sequences were used to determine if these regions could amplify by PCR. The fragment generated by the pJ7.6B primers located approximately 63kb upstream of exon 1, was present in both probands. Sequence from clone 145B8 (Genbank ID# 4582842) was used to design primers amplifying fragments located 1kb, 10kb, 18kb, 25kb, and 57kb upstream of exon 1 (Table 1). None of these fragments could be generated by PCR in either  [van Bokhoven et al., 1994a],  suggesting  a deletion of  this  proband, region. Although DNA sequencing and Southern blot analysis were not performed, RNA from Family 1 was examined by RT-PCR to determine if the CHM transcript was present. An RNA sample prepared from lymphoblastoid cells of an affected male from Family 1 was subjected to RT-PCR using several pairs of exonic primers (281/532, PTT 1a/532) within the CHM gene. While these primers failed to generate a product, control primers outside of the CHM gene successfully amplified the correct product. In a control RNA sample, both the control primers as well as correct fragments (data not shown). The probands of these two families did not share alleles for the intron 9 polymorphism.  the CHM primers  generated  the  CHM gene deletions. Deletion of the entire CHM gene was suggested by the repeated failure of amplification of all 15 CHM exons by PCR in affected males from Families 44 and 50. PCR primers CHM 50-1 kb, 10 kb, -18 kb, -25 kb, and -57 kb also failed to  194  McTAGGART ET AL.  generate products, extended to at least 57 kb 50 of the CHM gene.  indicating that  the deletion  CHM partial deletions. Consecutive exons in the CHM gene failed to amplify in the affected males of three families (10, 65, and 68), suggesting the presence of a partial deletion. Two of these patients had intragenic deletions (exons 3 to 8, and exons 5 to 8), while the third had a deletion of exons 9 through 15, as well as a deletion of WI-11849 located 2.9kb down- stream of exon 15. The extent of the deletion down- stream of the CHM gene has not been characterized. Of the two intragenic deletions, one (Family 10) was confirmed through sequencing of an RT-PCR product spanning the deletion. Exonic primers 281 (in exon 4) and 1346 (in exon 10) were designed for this purpose. This analysis demonstrated the direct spli- cing of exon 4 to exon 9, while still maintaining the correct reading frame. The mutation results in the production of a protein with a normal REP1 N terminus and C terminus but lacking amino acids 105 through 388 (S105_C388del). RNA was unavailable from the second individual (Family 65) with an intragenic deletion. It is likely, however, that exon 2 is spliced directly to exon 9 as sequencing of genomic DNA demonstrated that both these exons are complete with no mutations in the splice site junctions. This intragenic deletion would also main- tain the reading frame, resulting in a protein missing amino acids 40 through 389 (R40_R389del).  Splice site mutations. In total, seven splice site mutations were identified (Families 6, 13, 45, 46, 59, 70, and 98) by sequencing PCR products amplified from genomic DNA. All of these mutations, with the exception of those characterized in Families 45 and 46, occurred at positions in the splice sites that display 100% consensus [Senapathy et al., 1990]. Further analysis of the effects of these mutations on splicing was demonstrated in Families 13 and 45, using RT- PCR. Following the identification of conformational shifts of exon 11 in both families by PCR-SSCP, DNA sequencing of the fragments revealed mutations in the 30 splice site of intron 10. RNA samples prepared from a lymphoblastoid cell line of one of the affected males of Family 13 and from a peripheral blood sample of the affected male of Family 45 were subjected to RT-PCR using primers from Beaufre`re et al. [1997]. Sequen- cing of the resulting fragments confirmed the direct splicing of exon 10 to exon 12. The absence of exon 11 from the CHM mRNA transcript shifts the reading frame, resulting in an alteration of amino acids 450 through 453, and the production of a stop codon at position 454 (R450fsX454).  Several REP1 negative patients did not have mutations in exonic sequences or flanking splice sites (Families 16, 18, and 57). These results do not rule out the possibility of mutations in the introns creating  cryptic splice sites or mutations in the upstream promoter region.  Immunoblot Analysis  DISCUSSION  Conclusive results of  the immunoblot analysis supported the clinical diagnosis of CHM in all but one of the 22 families. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of CHM could not be confirmed in all patients by immunoblot analysis as protein was not available for study. In addition, the integrity of protein samples obtained from peripheral blood samples sent to the laboratory by courier was less than ideal. In most instances, the protein extraction was performed at least 24 hr after the sampling and the sample itself was often subjected to varying environmental conditions during shipping. While immunoblot analysis may be sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of CHM, as suggested in an earlier report [MacDonald et al., 1998], it may not necessarily exclude the diagnosis. For example, in one family whose diagnosis was not supported by immunoblot analysis, sequencing of the probands DNA demonstrated the presence of a frame-shift mutation. No explanation could be found. However, in all other cases, mutations in the CHM gene resulted in truncation and presumed degradation of the protein product, as REP1 was not detected. At this point, we increasingly rely on mutational screen- ing of the CHM gene to search for alterations in the exonic sequences and splice sites.  Mutation Analysis  Mutation analysis serves as a final confirmation of the diagnosis of CHM. PCR-SSCP failed to detect a shift in two REP1 negative individuals. DNA sequen- cing of the CHM gene in these two patients also failed to find a mutation. This however does not exclude the possibility of the presence of mutations within introns or in the promoter region.  One of the more interesting mutations was a frameshift mutation characterized in Family 35. This complex mutation replaces 9 bp with 8 bp of unrelated sequence and occurs in the vicinity of several small deletions, one of which is present in three of our families (555_556delAG). Adjacent to these deletions are several runs of A and G residues, as well as short direct repeats. Krawczak and Cooper [1991] reported a correlation between the presence of short deletions and these local sequence elements. The exact role of local sequence environment in the generation of short deletions has not been demonstrated but it has been suggested that an event such as slipped mispairing may occur at the replication fork [Krawczak and Cooper, 1991; Kunkel and Soni, 1988]. We speculate that it could also be possible that the local sequence environment renders this area susceptible to other  mutational events such as homologous recombination that could generate the deletion/insertion mutation characterized in Family 35.  this disorder,  Despite the fact that there is no common mutation for identical mutations have been characterized in unrelated individuals. With the exception of the larger intragenic and full CHM gene deletions 15 of the mutations characterized in our families have been reported in other families [Beau- fre`re et al., 1997; Forsythe et al., 1997; Fujiki et al., 1999; Nesslinger et al., 1996; Preising and Pawlo- witzki, 1993; Trujillo et al., 1998; van Bokhoven et al., 1994a; van den Hurk et al., 1997].  Of particular  interest,  four different  recurring mutations characterized in our families are C to T transitions resulting in the conversion of an arginine residue (CGA) to a stop codon (TGA). Interestingly, there are only five CGA codons in the entire CHM gene. The C to T transition at position 787 was found in eight families in this report, however polymorphism analysis failed to differentiate all of these families from each other and thus we cannot rule out the possibility that they share a common ancestor who possessed the mutation. The C to T transitions at positions 745 and 838 in exon 6 were each characterized in two families in this report, and the C to T transition at position 829 was reported in three families. All four of these transitions have been reported elsewhere [Beaufre`re et al., 1997; Fujiki et al., 1999; Preising and Pawlowitzki, 1993; van den Hurk et al., 1997].  In a survey done by Cooper and Youssoufian [1988], it was estimated that one-third of mutations causing human inherited disease occurred at CpG (C to T or G to A transitions). dinucleotides Methylation of the cytosine residue to 5-methyl cytosine increases the frequency of transition muta- tions resulting from the propensity of 5-methyl cytosine to undergo spontaneous deamination, form- ing thymine [Coulondre et al., 1978]. Over 90% of 5-methyl cytosine residues in vertebrate genomes exist within CpG dinucleotides [Grippo et al., 1968]. The methylation status of the cytosine residues present in the arginine codons of the CHM gene is unknown. However, the recurring mutations in these locations may be a result of methylation and the subsequent increase in the rate of transition mutations. C to T transitions at these locations convert an arginine residue to a stop codon, resulting in truncation of the protein and the CHM phenotype. The fact that the CHM phenotype is readily identified and, in most cases, is not confused with other diagnoses may reflect that all mutations result in the truncation and absence of the normal gene product. The absence of missense mutations in patients with CHM may suggest that either these changes are accommodated by the protein and have no effect on structure and function, or that they result in a phenotype clinically different from CHM.

Cremers Novel types of mutation in the choroideremia(CHM) gene:  a full-length L1 insertion and an intronic mutation  activating a cryptic exon  Received: 28 January 2003 / Accepted: 7 May 2003 / Published online: 25 June 2003  Springer-Verlag 2003  Abstract Choroideremia (CHM) is a progressive chorio- retinal  degeneration  caused  by  mutations  in  the  widely expressed CHM gene on chromosome Xq21. The product of  this  gene,  Rab  escort  protein  (REP)-1,  is  involved  in the  posttranslational  lipid  modification  and  subsequent membrane targeting of Rab proteins, small GTPases that play  a  key  role  in  intracellular  trafficking.  We  have searched for mutations of the CHM gene in patients with choroideremia by analysis of individual CHM exons and adjacent intronic sequences PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis of the coding region of the CHM mRNA. In 35 patients, at least 21 different causative CHM defects were identified. These included two partial CHM gene deletions and an in- sertion of a full-length L1 retrotransposon into the coding region of the CHM gene, a type of mutation that has not been previously reported as a cause of CHM. We also de- tected  nine  different  nonsense  mutations,  five  of  which are  recurrent,  a  small  deletion,  a  small  insertion,  and  at least five distinct splice site mutations, one of which has  )  D.

Moreover,  we  report  for  the first time the identification of an intronic mutation remote from the exon-intron junctions that creates a strong accep- tor splice site and leads to the inclusion of a cryptic exon into the CHM mRNA. Finally, in an affected male who did not have a mutation in any of the CHM exons or their splice sites,  the  deletion  of  a  complete  exon  from  the CHM mRNA was observed.  Introduction  Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked eye disease charac- terized by progressive degeneration of the photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium, and choriocapillaris. Affected males  experience  night  blindness,  followed  by  progres- sive  visual  field  loss  leading  to  tunnel  vision  and  often blindness. Female carriers generally show no serious vi- sual impairment, but they have patchy areas of chorioreti- nal degeneration (Heckenlively and Bird 1988).  The gene involved in CHM was isolated from Xq21 by positional  cloning.  The CHM gene  comprises  15  coding exons  that  span  a  genomic  sequence  of  approximately 186 kb (Cremers et al. 1990; Merry et al. 1992; van Bok- hoven et al. 1994a). The CHM gene product is a protein of 653 amino acids, designated Rab escort protein (REP)-1, which plays an essential role in the posttranslational lipid modification and subsequent membrane targeting of Rab proteins (Alexandrov et al. 1994; Andres et al. 1993; Seabra et al. 1992, 1993). Rabs are small GTP-binding proteins that act as key regulators of intracellular vesicular trans- port (Martinez and Goud 1998; Novick and Zerial 1997). Rab GTPases require the covalent attachment of one or, in most cases, two geranylgeranyl groups to cysteine residues at their C-terminus. This modification is critical for their reversible membrane association and interaction with other proteins (Kinsella and Maltese 1992; Maltese et al. 1996). The  addition  of  geranylgeranyl  groups  is  catalyzed  by Rab  geranylgeranyltransferase  (RabGGTase).  REP  binds newly  synthesized  Rab  protein  and  present  it  to  this  en- zyme  (Anant  et  al.  1998;  Andres  et  al.  1993).  Alterna-  tively,  REP  first  associates  with  RabGGTase  and  then  a Rab  protein  is  recruited  (Thom  et  al.  2001).  After  ger- anylgeranylation, REP remains complexed to the Rab pro- tein  and  delivers  it  to  the  appropriate  intracellular  mem- brane (Alexandrov et al. 1994; Andres et al. 1993; Wilson et al. 1996).  REP-1 is one of two REPs known in humans. The in- tronless choroideremia-like (CHML) gene located on the distal part of chromosome 1q encodes REP-2 (Cremers et al.  1992,  1994).  Both  REP-1  and  REP-2  are  widely  ex- pressed (Cremers et al. 1990; Desnoyers et al. 1998; au- thors unpublished data). REP-2 is most likely capable of compensating for the deficiency of REP-1 in patients with choroideremia,  thereby  preventing  manifestations  in  tis- sues and organs other than the eye (Cremers et al. 1994). It remains to be clarified why the loss of REP-1 activity specifically leads to chorioretinal degeneration.  The spectrum of defects identified in the CHM gene of patients suffering from choroideremia includes deletions, translocations, and a variety of subtle mutations. Deletions vary in size from a few kilobases, removing a single exon, to ~15 Mb, comprising the complete CHM gene and virtu- ally the entire Xq21 band (Fujiki et al. 1999; McTaggart et al.  2002;  van  den  Hurk  et  al.  1997).  Translocations  that disrupt the CHM gene have been found in two female pa- tients with mild clinical symptoms of choroideremia (Cre- mers et al. 1990; van Bokhoven et al. 1994a). Among the subtle mutations detected in the CHM gene are nonsense, frameshift,  and  splice  site  mutations  (Beaufrre  et  al. 1996, 1997, 1998; Forsyth et al. 1997; Fujiki et al. 1999; Hotta et al. 1997; McTaggart et al. 2002; Nesslinger et al. 1996; Trujillo et al. 1998; van den Hurk et al. 1997). Most, if not all of these mutations give rise to a premature ter- mination codon. Missense mutations have not been iden- tified.  Here, we report the results of molecular analysis of the CHM gene  in  35  patients  with  a  clinical  diagnosis  of choroideremia. In these 35 patients, a total of 21, possibly 22, distinct CHM defects were detected and characterized at  the  genomic  level,  the  mRNA  level,  or  both.  Signifi- cantly, these include two types of mutation that have not been previously identified in the CHM gene. One is an in- sertion of a full-length L1 element into the coding region of  the CHM gene,  whereas  the  other  one  is  an  intronic mutation that is remote from the actual splice sites and ac- tivates a cryptic exon. Our results thus expand the reper- toire of mutations that cause choroideremia.  Material and methods  Patients  Patients were examined by fundoscopy and functional ophthalmo- logic methods by different ophthalmologists. The diagnostic crite- ria of choroideremia included a history of night blindness and the typical appearance of the fundus, showing peripheral pigmentary retinopathy with areas of pigment epithelial and choroidal atrophy (see, for instance, Heckenlively and Bird 1988). In most cases, the diagnosis was supported by a pattern of X-linked inheritance and/ or ophthalmoscopical carrier signs in the mother, sisters, or daugh-  ters. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood lymphocytes of pa- tients and their relatives by a salt extraction procedure (Miller et al. 1988).  269  PCR amplification  and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis  Individual CHM exons and adjacent intronic sequences were PCR- amplified from genomic DNA using primers that were published previously (van Bokhoven et al. 1994b). SSCP analysis was per- formed essentially as described (van den Hurk et al. 1992). In brief, PCR  reactions  were  carried  out  with  32P-end-labeled  primers. Products  were  denatured  and  applied  to  5%  polyacrylamide  gels (acrylamide:bisacrylamide=19:1)  containing  10%  glycerol.  Gels were  dried  and  exposed  to  Kodak  X-ray  films.  PCR  fragments with altered electrophoretic mobility were further analyzed by se- quencing.  Molecular characterization of large rearrangements  Molecular  analysis  of  gross  aberrations  was  carried  out  with  the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche) following the proto- col  provided  by  the  manufacturer.  Primers  5-F,  5-TACCAC- CACTACAACTACAGGCTTGGA-3,  and  intron 1-R,  5-TTTA- ATGAGCGGGACCTTGGACC-3,  and  primers  intron 2-F,  5- CCTGCCTTGGTTGTCTATAAACGGA-3,  and  intron 12-R,  5- TGTCGAATGGAAGGGCTGCAAA-3,  were  used  to  determine the extent of the deletions in patients 8527 and 9155, respectively. For the characterization of the defect in patient 19089, previously published primers derived from exon 5 and intron 7 (van Bokhoven et al. 1994b) were used initially. For subsequent analysis, primers intron 5-F, 5-GAATTTCAGCTAATCAATTCTGAGCCTG-3, and intron 6-R,  5-CGGAGGACTGGAATTTACTGCTTTATGA-3, were employed. PCR products were analyzed on 0.51% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and (partially) sequenced.  Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis  Total RNA was isolated from lymphoblastoid cell lines with RNAzol (Campro Scientific) and treated with DNase I (GibcoBRL). Reverse transcription of total RNA was performed using random hexamer primers [pd(N)6, AmershamPharmacia] and M-MLV reverse tran- scriptase (GibcoBRL) according to the manufacturers recommen- dations.  For  PCR  amplification  of  the CHM coding  region  from cDNA, the following primer pairs were used: exon 1-F, 5-AGTCA- CATGACACGTTTCCCG-3, and exon 5-R, 5-GTCACTTCAGC- ACCATTTAC-3; exon 5-F, 5-GATCCAGAGAATGCGCTAG-3, and  exon 8-R,  5-TGGGGGTTAATTTTTGAGTC-3;  exon 8-F, 5-GATATGAAGAGATCACATTTT-3 and exon 13-R, 5-CTG- ATTCTAAATCTTCTCTTGC-3;  exon 11-F,  5-GCAGATCTC- CAGGGCAGTG-3, and exon 15-R, 5-GGGTATCCAGTTTGG- TGTATA-3. Products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide, excised, and sequenced.  Molecular analysis of intronic sequence variations Primers  used  to  amplify  intron 4  sequences  were  intron 4-F,  5- GCCTTCCATTTGGAGTTACA-3, and intron 4-R, 5-CTCTTT- GCTTTAAGAGCTCC-3 ,  which  produce  a  fragment  of  330 bp. PCR  of  intronic  sequences  flanking  exon 12  was  performed  with oligonucleotides  intron 11-F,  5-GGTTACTCAACCTGTAGTA- AG-3,  and  intron 12-R,  5-AGGGGATGGTGTGAAATGAC-3, amplifying a product of 548 bp. PCR fragments were checked on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and analyzed by sequencing.  270  Fig. 1A, B Large rearrangements involving the CHM gene. A Par- tial CHM deletions.

B L1 in- sertion in CHM exon 6. PCR analysis of genomic DNA from pa- tient 19089 and a control individual using primers that flank exon 6 is shown on the left. Instead of the normal 410-bp product, these primers  amplify  a  fragment  of  about  6.5 kb  from  the  patients DNA. A 1-kb DNA ladder (Invitrogen) was loaded as a marker. A schematic drawing of the L1 insertion in patient 19089 is shown on the right. The L1 element is integrated in the 35 orientation into exon 6. The 14-bp target site duplication that surrounds the el- ement is underlined  Nucleotide sequence analysis  PCR products were either purified using Multiscreen plates (Milli- pore)  or  isolated  from  agarose  gel  with  Qiaquick  columns  (Qia- gen). A (T)24A/C/G oligonucleotide was used for sequencing PCR fragments containing exon 3 and flanking intronic sequences. All other primers used for sequence analysis were the same as those employed for PCR amplification. Sequencing reactions were car- ried out by the use of BigDye Terminator chemistry according to the guidelines provided by the manufacturer (PE Applied Biosys- tems) and analyzed on an ABI 3700 capillary DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems).  Results  CHM mutations detected by analysis of genomic DNA  Initial  screening  for  mutations  in  25  patients  diagnosed with CHM was carried out by SSCP analysis of the 15 CHM exons  and  their  flanking  intronic  sequences  PCR-ampli- fied from genomic DNA. For three patients, one or more  fragments failed to be generated by PCR. Failure of exon 1 amplification  was  observed  for  patient  8527.  The  pres- ence of a deletion was confirmed by PCR using primers derived from sequences preceding exon 1 and intron 1 se- quences (Fig. 1A). These primers are 13.5 kb apart in the human genome and produced a 2.3-kb fragment from the patients DNA. The 11.2-kb deletion extends from nucleo- tides 12010 to 49+9140, as shown by sequence analysis of the PCR fragment. For patient 9155, no PCR products were obtained for exons 312, indicating a deletion of this region.  PCR  with  primers  located  in  intron 2  and  intron 12, which are 109 kb apart in the human genome, resulted in a fragment of approximately 17 kb. These findings demon- strate that the physical size of the intragenic CHM deletion in this patient corresponds to 92 kb (Fig. 1A).  For patient 19089, PCR amplification initially failed to produce an exon 6 fragment. More detailed analysis, how- ever,  showed  that  exon 6  was  not  deleted  in  this  patient but  was  instead  increased  in  size  by  approximately  6 kb (Fig. 1B). Partial sequence analysis of the enlarged fragment revealed the insertion of an L1 element in reverse orienta- tion into the coding region of exon 6. The L1 retrotranspo- son is flanked by a perfect 14-bp duplication of the target site. To determine the effect of the L1 insertion on splic- ing, RNA from patient 19089 was examined by RT-PCR using primers derived from exon 5 and exon 8. Sequenc- ing  of  the  resulting  fragment  demonstrated  the  direct splicing of exon 5 to exon 7. The absence of exon 6 from the CHM mRNA maintains the reading frame, predicting a protein product that lacks amino acids 235 through 273 (L235_Q273del).  For  16  of  the  remaining  22  patients,  bandshifts  were detected upon SSCP analysis and sequencing of the corre- sponding  PCR  fragments  revealed  13  different  sequence alterations (Table 1). These included seven nonsense mu- tations. R293X was found in four apparently unrelated pa- tients, whereas R239X, R253X, Y308X, S453X, W548X, and C575X were detected in one patient each.  Table 1 Small mutations in the CHM gene  Patient  Location  Mutationa  Effect  271  aThe first base of the ATG ini- tiaton codon is denoted nu- cleotide 1, in accordance with the recommendations for a hu- man gene mutation nomencla- ture (den Dunnen and Antona- rakis 2001).

The 15-bp sequence that is inserted after nucleotide 1531 in exon 13 in patient 229 is indicated in bold, with grey background  shading.  This  in-frame  insertion  encodes two  aberrant  amino  acids  followed  by  a  premature  termination codon.

The  donor  and  acceptor sites  used  for  normal  splicing  of  exon 3  and  exon 4  are  shown. Lowercase letters indicate intronic sequences, whereas uppercase letters indicate exonic sequences. The amino acid sequence in the relevant region is also indicated. The A>G nucleotide substitution at position 1902 that inactivates the 3 splice site in intron 3 in pa- tient 2096 is indicated by an arrow. Utilization of a cryptic splice site  within  exon 4  causes  the  deletion  of  8 bp  from  the CHM mRNA, which in turn results in a premature termination codon  In patient 10870, a deletion of the tetranucleotide TACT in exon 5 causes a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon. An in-frame insertion of 15 nucleotides in exon 13 of the CHM gene was found in patient 229 (Fig. 2A). This 15-bp insertion encodes a termination codon. Notably, the same patient had a silent substitution 1377A>T (T459T) in CHM exon 11.  Sequence alterations affecting splice sites were identi- fied in four patients. Patient 14047 carries a de novo mu- tation  at  position  +5  of  the  donor  splice  site  in  intron 1. RT-PCR on the patients RNA with primers derived from exons  1  and  5  consistently  failed  to  amplify  a  product, whereas primer combinations located in downstream ex- ons  yielded  products  of  the  appropriate  size.  In  patient  272  Fig. 3 Intronic mutation in the CHM gene. The 98-bp se- quence inserted between exon 4 and exon 5 in CHM mRNA of patients 2085 and 2688 is shown in the upper part of the figure. The predicted amino acid sequence is also indicated, showing that the additional exon eventually results in pre- mature termination of transla- tion. A schematic diagram of the relevant region in the CHM mRNA is indicated in the lower part of the figure. The cryptic exon that separates exon 4 and exon 5 is derived from intron 4 sequences (314+ 10129 to +10226). The T>A nucleotide substitution at posi- tion 314+10127 is indicated in bold. This mutation creates a  3 splice site that, together with a branchpoint and a 5 splice site, defines the cryptic exon within intron 4  3247, a 116+1G>A mutation that alters a strictly conserved nucleotide  of  the  splice  site  donor  sequence  in  intron 2 was  identified.  Patient  6766  showed  a  T>G  nucleotide substitution at position 8 of the acceptor splice site in in- tron 6. Sequence analysis failed to detect mutations in the other  exons  and  flanking  intronic  sequences  amplified from the patients DNA. No mRNA was available to ex- amine  the  effect  of  this  sequence  alteration  on  splicing. Patient 3131 carries a mutation in the invariant AG dinu- cleotide of the acceptor splice site in intron 7.  To identify mutations that escaped detection by SSCP analysis, sequencing of all 15 PCR-amplified CHM exons and adjacent intronic sequences was performed for the re- maining six patients and an additional ten CHM patients that had been negative in preceding PCR-SSCP analyses (van  den  Hurk  et  al.  1997).  Causative  mutations  were identified in one and three patients, respectively (Table 1). These  included  nonsense  mutations  R270X  and  E272X, both  located  in  exon 6.  Patient  2474  carries  a  G>A  nu- cleotide substitution at position 189+1 of the 5 splice site in intron 3. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated the deletion of exon 3  from  the CHM transcript,  which  in  turn  causes  a frameshift that gives rise to a premature termination codon. In  patient  2096,  a  mutation  at  position  1902  of  the  3 splice site of exon 4 was identified. Utilization of a cryp- tic splice acceptor site within exon 4 causes the deletion of the first eight nucleotides of exon 4 from the CHM mRNA (Fig. 2B). As a consequence, an inappropriate termination codon is introduced.  CHM defects identified by analysis of mRNA  In a further attempt to identify causative mutations, RT-PCR analysis covering the coding region of the CHM mRNA was performed for seven of the 12 remaining patients. For three of these, products of an inappropriate size were ob- served  and  characterized  in  detail  by  sequence  analysis (Table 1). CHM mRNA  of  patients  2085  and  2688  con- tained  an  additional  98-bp  sequence  separating  exons  4 and 5. This cryptic exon disrupts the open reading frame and  leads  to  a  premature  stop  codon  (Fig. 3).  The  extra fragment was identified as part of intron 4 (position 314+ 10129  to  314+10226).  PCR  amplification  of  this  region and  the  surrounding  sequences  from  genomic  DNA  and subsequent sequence analysis revealed a T>A nucleotide substitution at position 314+10127 in intron 4 in both pa- tients. The mutation creates a splice acceptor site with the exceptionally  high  score  of  99.7  (according  to  Shapiro and Senapathy 1987). The novel splice site is preceded by a sequence that is a perfect match of the branch site con- sensus  and  a  splice  donor  site  is  located  farther  down- stream (Fig. 3). Thus, the T>A alteration at position 314+ 10127 creates a novel 3 splice site in intron 4 and causes the inclusion of 98 bp of intronic sequences into the CHM transcript.  In CHM mRNA  from  patient  1166,  exons  11  and  13 are directly joined (Fig. 4). The absence of exon 12 shifts the reading frame and results in a premature termination codon.  Analysis  of  genomic  DNA  from  this  patient  had previously failed to reveal a mutation in the 15 CHM ex- ons and their splice sites. PCR amplification and sequenc- ing  of  a  fragment  including  exon 12,  the  flanking  splice sites,  and  451 bp  of  surrounding  intronic  sequences  re-  273  human  genome  (International  Human  Genome  Sequenc- ing Consortium 2001; Smit 1999), the vast majority of these are functionally inactive due to 5 truncations, rearrange- ments, or point mutations. L1 retrotransposition events oc- casionally cause genetic disease in humans (Brouha et al. 2002; Ostertag and Kazazian 2001). Insertional mutations by full-length L1 elements have only been reported in the -globin and retinitis pigmentosa type 2 genes (Divoky et al.  1996;  Kimberland  et  al.  1999;  Schwahn  et  al.  1998). The 6-kb L1 element that has been identified in the CHM gene of patient 19089 thus represents the third full-length L1 insertion involved in a human disorder. The L1 retro- transposition causes the deletion of exon 6 from the CHM mRNA. As the reading frame is maintained, this results in a  protein  product  missing  amino  acids  235  through  273 (L235_Q273del). Interestingly, these amino acids are part of structurally conserved region (SCR) 2, one of several regions conserved between REPs and Rab GDP dissocia- tion inhibitors (GDIs) (Schalk et al. 1996; Waldherr et al. 1993).  RabGDIs  play  a  critical  role  in  the  recycling  of Rab proteins (Pfeffer et al. 1995). The SCR2 amino acids absent in REP-1 of patient 19089 participate in the forma- tion of a hydrophobic groove that presumably binds one of the  geranylgeranyl  groups  attached  to  the  C-terminus  of Rab proteins (Pylypenko et al. 2003).  Besides  large  rearrangements,  a  total  of  18  different subtle  sequence  alterations  were  identified  in  the CHM gene (Table 1). One of these, R293X, was detected in four patients  and  has  already  been  reported  in  two  unrelated patients with CHM (MacDonald et al. 1998; van Bokhoven et  al.  1994b).  Other  recurrent  mutations  are  116+1G> A  (Fujiki  et  al.  1999;  McTaggart  et  al.  2002),  R239X  (McTaggart  et  al.  2002),  R253X  (Fujiki  et  al.  1999;  McTaggart  et  al.  2002),  and  R270X  (Fujiki  et  al.  1999; McTaggart  et  al.  2002).  All  of  these  mutations  involve C>T  or  G>A  transitions  at  CpG  dinucleotides  and  may thus  reflect  the  hypermutability  of  these  sites.  Mutation S453X was found in a German patient and has previously been  reported  in  another  CHM  patient  from  Germany (van den Hurk et al. 1992). Thus, this mutation may not be truly recurrent but identical-by-descent.  The  remaining  12  small  mutations  are  novel.  One  of the  four  distinct  nonsense  mutations,  i.e.  the  C>A  nu- cleotide substitution at position 1725 in exon 14, predicts a  CHM  protein  lacking  only  79  amino  acids  at  the  car- boxyl-terminus, which is the smallest truncation reported to date. The TACT deletion in exon 5 may be explained by slipped  mispairing  during  DNA  replication  since  this tetranucleotide is tandemly repeated in the normal CHM sequence. A similar mechanism may account for the 15-bp insertion in exon 13. The inserted sequence shows a strong resemblance to nucleotides 15341549 of the normal CHM gene.  Three of the novel mutations occurred at strictly con- served nucleotides in splice sites. An additional mutation is located at position +5 of the splice donor site in intron 1. Although  more  detailed  studies  would  be  required  to determine  its  precise  effect,  RT-PCR  analysis  left  little doubt  that  this  mutation  interferes  with  correct  splicing.  Fig. 4 Exon skipping in the CHM mRNA. RT-PCR analysis cov- ering the coding region of CHM mRNA from patient 1166 and a control individual. RT-PCR products corresponding to exons 813 and exons 1115 are 97 bp smaller for patient 1166 compared with the  control.  A  100-bp  DNA  ladder  (Invitrogen)  was  loaded  as  a marker. Nucleotide sequencing of the aberrant RT-PCR products from patient 1166 revealed a deletion of the entire exon 12  vealed  a  C>G  alteration  at  position  1414125  that  was also found in control subjects. No mutation that might ex- plain the deletion of exon 12 from the CHM transcript of this  patient  could  be  detected  within  the  analyzed  DNA segment.  Discussion  A systematic search for mutations in patients with a clini- cal  diagnosis  of  choroideremia  revealed  large  rearrange- ments as well as more subtle mutations in the CHM gene. Large  rearrangements  included  two  partial CHM gene deletions  and  an  L1  insertion  into  exon 6  of  the CHM gene. Whereas deletions of different sizes constitute about one-fifth  of  all  defects  that  have  been  described  in  the CHM gene, insertional mutation by an L1 element has not been previously reported as a cause of CHM.  LINE-1 or L1 elements are autonomous retrotransposons that lack long terminal repeats. They multiply by a process involving  transcription,  reverse  transcription,  and  reinte- gration  into  a  new  chromosomal  site.  Retrotransposition typically involves a variable length target site duplication (Kazazian and Moran 1998). A full-length human L1 ele- ment is approximately 6 kb and contains two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) preceded by a 5-untranslated region with an internal promoter and followed by a 3-un- translated  region  ending  with  a  polyA  tail  (Scott  et  al. 1987). Although roughly 500,000 L1 elements exist in the  274  The consequence, if any, of a T>G change at position 8 within the pyrimidine tract that precedes exon 7, remains to  be  established.  This  nucleotide  substitution  does  not lead to a dramatic deviation from the splice site consensus sequence (86.380.8 according to Shapiro and Senapathy 1987).  Nevertheless,  a  T>G  nucleotide  substitution  at position 8 that causes exon skipping in PEX3 has been documented (Muntau et al. 2000). Finally, a mutation well within CHM intron 4 that interferes with correct splicing was  identified.  This  intronic  mutation  at  position  314+ 10127 creates a strong acceptor splice site and results in the inclusion of a cryptic exon into the CHM mRNA. The mutation was detected in two German patients and, there- fore, the possibility of a common ancestor cannot be ruled out.  The 314+10127T>A nucleotide substitution in intron 4 represents  the  first  intronic CHM mutation  remote  from the  actual  splice  sites  reported  to  date.  In  general,  rela- tively few intronic mutations situated outside the immedi- ate intron-exon junctions have been reported as causes of human disease. The CHM gene comprises about 180 kb of intronic  sequences  and  it  is,  therefore,  likely  that  addi- tional  intronic  mutations  will  be  identified  in  CHM  pa- tients.  In  this  context,  the  skipping  of  exon 12  in CHM mRNA  from  patient  1166  is  of  interest.  Analysis  of  the patients DNA failed to reveal a mutation in exon 12 and the flanking splice sites. With the exception of a polymor- phic base, no sequence alteration could be detected in up- stream intronic sequences including the putative branch site, and  downstream  intronic  sequences  comprising  a  G-rich element  reminiscent  of  human  intronic  splice  enhancer motifs  (Cogan  et  al.  1997;  McCarthy  and  Phillips  1998; McCullough  and  Berget  1997).  These  findings  indicate that  the  basic  splicing  signals  alone  are  not  sufficient  to achieve accurate splicing of CHM exon 12. More detailed analysis  of CHM intron  11  (6.4 kb)  and CHM intron 12 (15.1 kb)  may  reveal  the  causative  mutation  in  patient 1166 and perhaps also the existence of intronic sequences required for correct splicing of the CHM mRNA.  A  substantial  part  of CHM gene  defects  can  be  de- tected by the analysis of PCR-amplified CHM exons and their splice boundaries. Combining the results of this and our previous study (van den Hurk et al. 1997), causative mutations have been identified in 7580% of patients with choroideremia  using  this  approach,  while  Fujiki  et  al. (1999)  and  McTaggart  et  al.  (2002)  have  reached  detec- tion rates of 86% and 95%, respectively. Certain types of mutation,  e.g.,  mutations  remote  from  the  coding  exons and their splice sites, will go undetected by methods that examine genomic DNA only. Therefore, analysis of CHM mRNA is a logical next step for patients that do not have a mutation in CHM exonic sequences and flanking splice sites. Although RNA was unavailable for some of these, RT-PCR and sequence analysis revealed alterations in the coding region of the CHM mRNA in 43% of the patients examined. The other 57% of these patients may have mu- tations in the untranslated regions or the promoter of the CHM gene. For those individuals for whom no mutations in the CHM gene can be defined, the clinical diagnosis of  choroideremia may be confirmed by immunoblot analysis using an antibody against REP-1, the CHM gene product (MacDonald et al. 1998; McTaggart et al. 2002). The con- secutive analysis of CHM exons and their splice sites am- plified from genomic DNA, RT-PCR analysis of the CHM mRNA  and  immunoblot  analysis  of  the  CHM  protein should allow a molecular diagnosis of CHM for the vast majority of patients.

16935340	Choroideremia: Variability of Clinical and Electrophysiological Characteristics and First Report of a Negative Electroretinogram  Agnes B. Renner, MD,1 Ulrich Kellner, MD,1,2,3 Elke Cropp,1 Markus N. Preising, PhD,4 Ian M. MacDonald, MD, CM,5 Jos A. J. M. van den Hurk, MSc,6 Frans P. M. Cremers, PhD,6 Michael H. Foerster, MD1  Purpose: To analyze the variability of clinical and electrophysiological characteristics in X-linked choroider-  emia and provide the rst report of a negative electroretinogram in choroideremia.  Design: Retrospective study. Participants: The records of 18 male patients with choroideremia and 8 female carriers were evaluated. Methods: The data were reviewed regarding visual acuity (VA), color vision, perimetry, fundus autouores- cence, and full-eld electroretinography (according to standards of the International Society for Clinical Electro- physiology of Vision).  Main Outcome Measures: Morphological and functional phenotype characteristics, fundus autouores-  cence, electroretinography, and Rab escort protein 1 (REP-1) mutations.  Results: Four unrelated families with choroideremia (9 affected males, 7 carriers) and 10 unrelated individ- uals (9 affected males, 1 carrier) were included. Mutational analysis, performed in 2 families and 3 individual males, revealed REP-1 mutations in all except 1 male. The age of the males ranged from 5.9 to 63.0 years (mean, 33.9), and VA ranged from hand movements to 1.0 (median, 0.7). Fundus autouorescence (n  7) showed defects in the retinal pigment epithelium in all males. Electroretinography (n  13) was almost undetectable in 6 males and reduced in 6, indicating a rod cone dystrophy. A further male showed a negative electroretinogram, with a b:a wave ratio of 0.5. Visual acuity of the 8 carriers (age, 4.8 56.8 years [mean, 24.0]) ranged from light perception to 1.2 (median, 1.0). Light perception was present in 1 carrier manifesting choroideremia with distinct chorioretinal atrophy. Pigmentary stippling, seen in the other carriers, was seen in fundus autouorescence (n  1) with a distinct speckled pattern. Electroretinograms were normal in 6 of 7 and reduced in the manifesting carrier. Defects in color vision and visual eld were found in affected males and in the female carriers.  Conclusions: The phenotype of choroideremia presents with high variability. In addition to the previously reported ndings, we observed a negative electroretinogram, indicating a postreceptoral retinal dysfunction, in 1 affected male; severe course of choroideremia with early blindness in 1 manifesting carrier; color vision decits in the majority of affected males and carriers; and characteristic alterations in fundus autouorescence.

Since the rst report of choroideremia was published in 1872 by Mauthner, several further cases have been de- scribed in the literature however, often only as single cases or small series (for detailed references, see Krn1). The largest studies carried out so far are by Krn1 and Roberts et al2 with 84 and 115 affected males, respectively.  Choroideremia means an absence (eremia) of the choroid and is, as briey dened by Krill and Archer,3 a diffuse total choroidal vascular atrophy of X-linked inheritance. Today, it is known that choroideremia is a progressive diffuse degeneration of the rods and, independently, of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), with a later degeneration  Originally received: September 16, 2005.

In keeping with progressive fundus changes, patient symptoms include nyc- talopia, followed by visual eld (VF) defects, with progres- sion to extreme concentric eld loss and, nally, visual loss. In contrast, female carriers present with various abnormal fundus ndings, such as pigmentary stippling and spotty pigment atrophy in the periphery; however, retinal function remains normal. Females who manifest loss of visual func- tion with choroideremia are rare. The variability of the phenotype in carriers is explained by lyonization, a random X-inactivation.7 Electrophysiology typically reveals a se- verely reduced full-eld electroretinogram already at a young age in affected males, which is not recordable in later stages; however, female carriers mostly present with normal electroretinograms.8  In a normal electroretinogram, the b-wave amplitude is higher than the a-wave amplitude at all stimulus conditions. Both waves are largest in the scotopic standard combined response, which is used to calculate the b:a wave ratio. A so-called negative electroretinogram is an electroretinogram conguration in which the b-wave amplitude is smaller than the a-wave amplitude in the standard combined response, resulting in a b:a wave ratio  1.0 and indicating dysfunc- tion of the transmission in the inner retina. The previously unreported observation of a negative electroretinogram in  one patient of a chorioderemia family stimulated us retro- spectively to assess the clinical, functional, and, especially, electrophysiological ndings in males with choroideremia and female carriers.  Materials and Methods  The records of 26 patients, 18 males with choroideremia and 8 female carriers, referred to the Department of Ophthalmology of the Charit Campus Benjamin Franklin between 1991 and 2004 and the AugenZentrum Siegburg between 2004 and 2005 were evaluated. Three patients came for reexamination during the study period after initial visits ranging between 1975 and 1986. The clinical diagnosis was conrmed by one observer (UK). Clinical examinations and blood withdrawal for genetic analysis were conducted after informed consent was obtained. The research adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, and investi- gational review board approval was obtained. The diagnosis of choroideremia in males and carriers was based on clinical and electrophysiological ndings and family history in accordance with an X-linked inheritance and, where possible, was conrmed by molecular genetic analysis.

Fundus photography could be performed in 20 patients. Color vision was tested with the desaturated Panel D 15 test (n  18). Kinetic VF testing was performed with Goldmann perimetry (n  21). Fundus autouorescence imaging was carried out in 8 patients, as described in detail elsewhere.9  Electrophysiological testing included full-eld electroretinog-  raphy (n  20), ONOFF electroretinography (n  5), and electro- oculography (n  4). Recording equipment remained constant during all evaluations. Recording of electroretinograms and electro- oculograms was done according to the standards of the Interna- tional Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision.10,11 The recording protocols have been described in detail elsewhere.9,12,13 ONOFF electroretinograms were recorded with long-duration stimuli with green light-emitting diodes, as described previously.14  2068  Renner et al   Choroideremia  Electro-oculograms were recorded with a ramp test method, as described in detail elsewhere.15  Mutational analysis in REP-1 could be done in 5 affected males and 2 carriers of 2 unrelated families and 3 unrelated individuals. The methods used for genetic analysis are described in detail elsewhere for patient no. 60616; patient 78417,18; and patients 1629-F111, 1630-F111, 1631-F111, 1873, and 603.7 For patient 784, immunoblot analysis was performed on protein derived from a lymphoblastoid cell line using a monoclonal antibody, 2F1, against REP-1.19  To conrm our claim of the rst report of a negative electro- retinogram in choroideremia, we searched the online database PubMed for all reports of (1) choroideremia, (2) electrophysiolog- ical ndings in choroideremia, and (3) negative electroretino- grams. We have read all appropriate articles on this topic and have found no evidence of articles reporting a negative electroretino- gram in choroideremia.  Results  Tables 1 and 2 (available at http://aaojournal.org) give detailed information about the genetic, clinical, and functional data of all affected males and female carriers. Four unrelated families with choroideremia (9 affected males, 7 carriers) and 10 unrelated individuals (9 affected males, 1 carrier) were examined. Figure 1 illustrates the pedigrees of the 4 families. Except for one case, the pedigrees of the individual patients (not illustrated here) were in accordance with an X-linked inheritance, and there were always at least 2 known carriers or a further member with diagnosed cho- roideremia in the families. In the only patient (no. 1873) with a negative family history could a mutation in REP-1 be detected, in addition to 5 further patients (Table 1). In patient 606, a c.820- 8TG change was identied through sequence analysis of all exons of REP-1.16 In patient 784, exon 1 and a region up to 57 kb dened by primer pairs in the upstream sequence failed to amplify by polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis of protein derived from a lymphoblastoid line from this patient showed absence of REP-1, the normal gene product. In patient 1631-F111, a known nonsense mutation (R270X, c.838CT) (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 39[suppl]:294, 1998) was identied by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct se- quencing. No mutation could be detected in the coding region of REP-1 in patient 603. This result does not exclude the diagnosis of choroideremia because mutations in REP-1 have been identied in about two thirds of cases for which a family history was known.7 Thus, this method may have missed mutations by either the tech-  nique applied or the parts of the gene investigated. Patient 603 reported that both of his daughters were diagnosed as carriers.  Clinical and Functional Data of the Males with Choroideremia The mean age of the 18 affected males with choroideremia was 33.9 years (range, 5.9  63.0; median, 35.2) at the time of their rst visit. Five patients reported no visual disturbances; the remaining patients complained of night blindness, VF defects, photophobia, and reduced VA. The association between symptoms and patient age is shown in detail in Table 3. Visual acuity ranged from hand movements (HM) (3 eyes of 2 patients) to 1.0 (median, 0.7). Biomicroscopy detected a cataract of the posterior pole in only 2 patients (nos. 606 and 1873). Sixteen of the 18 male patients presented with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy with sparing of the mac- ula, and 2 male children (1644-F151 and 1631-F111) demonstrated a mottled appearance of the RPE in the periphery (Fig 2AH). There were no bone spicules, and the optic disc and retinal vessels were not markedly abnormal in any patient. Fundus autouorescence (n  7) was missing in areas of chorioretinal atrophy and still detectable in the remaining RPE of the macula in males with an advanced stage of choroideremia. In the young patient 1631-F111, the macula showed almost intact fundus autouorescence but peripheral irregularities like a speckled pattern, with small areas of reduced fundus autouorescence and a few larger areas of missing fundus autouorescence (Fig 2D, E).  Color vision defects were found in 7 of 11 patients and VF defects in 12 of 14 patients tested (Table 2 [available at http:// aaojournal.org]). Electroretinograms (n  13) were not recordable in 4 patients (ages 32.5, 36.1, 40.0, and 56.7 years); almost undetectable in 2 patients (ages 9.8 and 21.4); and severely re- duced in 6 patients, showing a rod cone dystrophy (mean age, 22.2; median, 22.9; range, 5.9 37.7) (Table 2, Fig 3). Unexpect- edly, one further patient (no. 1631-F111, 13.2 years old) presented with a negative electroretinogram and a b:a wave ratio in the standard combined response of 0.51 in the right eye and 0.56 in the left eye (Fig 3). The ON response showing a negative waveform as well was markedly reduced compared to the OFF response in the ONOFF electroretinogram (Fig 4). An ONOFF electroretino- gram also could be recorded in a patient (784-F151) in whom electroretinography showed a rod cone dystrophy (Table 2). The amplitudes of ON and OFF responses were similar and on the borderline (Fig 4). The EOG, tested in 2 patients (314-F219 and 784-F151), showed no light rise.  Follow-up data were available from 3 patients. Patient no. 314-F219 showed stable VA after 2 years, whereas the ring sco-  4 Figure 2.

Patient 1631-F111 presented with stable VA 3 years later. However, relative scotomas in the mid- periphery had developed on both eyes, and the negative electro- retinogram showed a further amplitude reduction (Fig 3). Patient 750-F111 was observed for 29 years (19752004). The data from the rst visit in 1975 are disclosed in Tables 1 and 2 (available at http://aaojournal.org). As a 9-year-old child, he was referred to our clinic because of suspected strabismus, which could not be con- rmed; however, funduscopy revealed mottled RPE changes re- sembling salt and pepper and chorioretinal atrophy. In 1976, VAs were 0.8 and 0.7 and the VF was slightly larger, with an enlarged blind spot but without any scotomas. In 1986 (21 years), VA was 0.6 in both eyes, with a progressive myopia. The outer extent of the VF was unchanged; however, a constriction for smaller light marks was visible, in contrast to the ndings in 1976. The last visit was in 2004 (38 years). Visual acuities were 0.7 and 0.4, with high myopia (7.75 and 8.0 diopters). Visual eld was constricted to about 8 to 12 (test mark III-4e). Color vision showed defects, and the electroretinogram was not recordable. Fundus photographs  from 1986 and 2004 are shown in Figure 2A, B. Fundus autouo- rescence was detectable, but only in the central macula, where RPE was still present (Fig 2C).  Clinical and Functional Data of the Female Carriers The mean age of the 8 female carriers was 24.0 years (range, 4.8 56.8; median, 18.9) at the time of their rst visit to our clinic. Carrier no. 540-F151 had manifested choroideremia. Visual acuity ranged from light perception (LP) to 1.2 (mean, 0.8; median, 1.0). Funduscopy revealed pigmentary stippling in 7 of 8 carriers and, in the manifesting carrier, distinct chorioretinal atrophy including the macula (Fig 2IK). Color vision defects were found in 6 of 7 carriers, and VF defects in 2 of 7. Electroretinography was normal in 6 of 7 and reduced in the manifesting carrier (Tables 1, 2 [available at http://aaojournal.org]). ONOFF electroretinography (patients 900, 881-F111, and 783-F151) and electro-oculography (patients 327-F151 and 783-F151) were normal. Carrier no. 900  2070  Renner et al   Choroideremia  Figure 4.

Patient 784-F151 presented with similar ON and OFF responses on the borderline, where ERG showed a rod cone dystrophy (Table 2 [available at http://aaojournal.org]).

However, the diagnosis of choroideremia carrier could be conrmed because the pedigree (and external examinations) revealed several affected males, including her son, and several carriers, including her daughters, with affected male children as well. Carrier 327- F151 was examined 5 times between 1986 and 2003. During this time, VA, VF, and electroretinography were always nor- mal. At the last visit, fundus autouorescence imaging was per- formed, showing a speckled pattern with small areas of reduced fundus autouorescence corresponding to the mottled RPE irreg- ularities (Fig 2L).  Discussion  Choroideremia is a progressive degeneration of the choroid, RPE, and photoreceptors that typically spares the macula over decades of life, thus ensuring good central VA over many years. The 18 affected males in this study presented with a median VA of 0.7. Visual acuity of HM was present in only 3 eyes of 2 patients, ages 54 and 58 years. However,  VA still sufcient for reading was found in 3 further pa- tients, ages 56, 56, and 63. Krn1 and Roberts et al2 also reported good VA in the majority of elderly patients. In most cases, the patients were still able to read at the age of 50.1 The study by Roberts et al2 even reported VA of counting ngers (or worse) only in patients older than 60. Surprisingly, the worst VA in our study was not detected among the affected males but in a manifesting female car- rier (no. 540-F151) who had already presented with HM vision in the right eye and LP vision in the left eye at an age of 41. The choroid and RPE were absent from her macula. This, to our knowledge, is the most severe case of a man- ifesting female carrier ever reported. Her daughters were both carriers as well and had no visual impairments in the presence of typical RPE irregularities. These fundus changes also were visible in fundus autouorescence, which is derived from lipofuscin in the RPE,20 and in vivo record- ing of fundus autouorescence provides information about the levels and distribution of lipofuscin of the RPE. A speckled pattern with small areas of reduced fundus autouorescence was seen in a carrier. A histopathologic study of a carrier found abnormal RPE with irregular thick- ness and pigmentation associated with variable lipofuscin content.21 Fundus autouorescence is a fast and noninvasive  2071  Ophthalmology Volume 113, Number 11, November 2006  method used to detect these changes in vivo. Because of the rareness of choroideremia and the relatively recent intro- duction of this method, fundus autouorescence data in carriers are limited. Fundus autouorescence ndings of other carriers, to our knowledge, have been presented only by Wegscheider et al, who reported autouorescence im- ages of 5 further carriers similar to our case (Invest Oph- thalmol Vis Sci 46:e-abstract 4088, 2005). This speckled pattern seems to be specic to female carriers of choroider- emia and may provide an additional phenotypic criterion for diagnosis, especially in carriers. Fundus autouorescence ndings in males with choroideremia depended on the stage of the disease. Imaging of fundus autouorescence will be helpful during follow-up due to the noninvasive observation of progressive alterations in the RPE.  Color vision defects in males with choroideremia were reported previously.1,7,22 In contrast, studies testing color vi- sion in carriers are rare and have reported normal ndings.7 In our study, almost all carriers showed mild color vision defects. These ndings imply a dysfunction of the macular cones. Because the full-eld electroretinogram can be normal in the face of macular dysfunction, the multifocal electroretinogram might be used as an additional diagnostic tool in patients and carriers to evaluate macular cone function.23  Full-eld electroretinography performed in former stud- ies revealed a reduction of the scotopic component before the photopic component and a nonrecordable electroretino- gram in later stages of choroideremia (for references in detail, see Krn1 and Sieving et al8). Our study supports these ndings. The electroretinogram was consistent with a rod cone dystrophy in our patients when still recordable. Sieving et al8 reported intrafamilial and interfamilial vari- abilities of electroretinography responses in males with cho- roideremia. Similar ndings also were seen in our study. Family 151 had 2 affected males, with a recordable elec- troretinogram at 5 (no. 1644-F151) and 28 years of age (no. 784-F151). The amplitudes of the standard combined re- sponse under scotopic conditions were severely and com- parably reduced, although the difference in age was 23 years, and the amplitudes under photopic conditions were only slightly higher in the younger male. The youngest patient with a nonrecordable electroretinogram was 32 years old (no. 616-F142), and the youngest patient with a nearly absent electroretinogram was 9 years old (no. 750-F111); however, the oldest patient who still had a recordable elec- troretinogram was 37 years old (no. 1720). This variability should be taken into account when counseling patients who tend to compare their own disease progression with those of their relatives. This present study strongly supports Sieving et als conclusion8 that disease progression in a younger family member is unpredictable from electroretinogram re- cordings of elder family members, relatives, or unrelated patients carrying the same mutation. This fact underlines the importance and necessity of follow-up studies in individual patients.  Unexpectedly, a negative ERG was recorded in one patient (no. 1631-F111). This was conrmed during follow- up after 3 years showing progress of amplitude reduction. The ONOFF electroretinogram showed a markedly re- duced ON response. A negative electroretinogram as well  2072  as a markedly reduced ON response indicate dysfunction of either the synaptic connection between photoreceptors and depolarizing ON-bipolar cells or the depolarizing bipolar cells itself. Dysfunction of the transmission in the inner retina and, therefore, a negative electroretinogram are characteristic of, for example, X-linked retinoschisis or congenital stationary night blindness, but appear in- frequently in other retinal dystrophies like retinitis pig- mentosa or conerod dystrophy.24 26 This is the rst report of a negative electroretinogram in choroideremia conrmed by genetic analysis. The REP-1 encodes the Rab escort protein 1, which functions with Rab to regu- late intracellular trafcking. This leads to the question, Is the negative electroretinogram caused by a dysfunction of the signal transmission between photoreceptor cells and bipolar cells because of disrupted intercellular traf- cking, or is it caused by a dysfunction in the bipolar cells itself? Because affected bipolars never have been reported in histopathological reports of either carriers or male patients,1,4,21,27,28 a primary degeneration of bi- polar cells by REP-1 mutations is not to be expected. A secondary effect by autoimmune response such as in melanoma-associated retinopathy or in other neoplastic tumor-related disorders producing secondary antibodies against bipolar cells is also unlikely because choroider- emia causes degeneration by apoptosis. This well- regulated form of degeneration avoids the production of antigens by controlled removal of degenerating cells. Earlier studies showed involvement of REP-1 in, for example, Rab3a geranylation.29,30 Rab3a is a major sig- nal in exocytosis of neuronal synaptic vesicles. Although Rab3a has not been reported as a REP-1specic target and all pathogenic sequence changes currently known are predicted to cause complete loss of the gene product, a direct relation of the underlying genetic defect and the negative electroretinogram thus cannot be concluded and is likely to be the effect of the individual situation in this proband.

16936131	Remodeling of the Human Retina in Choroideremia: Rab Escort Protein 1 (REP-1) Mutations  Samuel G. Jacobson,1 Artur V. Cideciyan,1 Alexander Sumaroka,1 Tomas S. Aleman,1 Sharon B. Schwartz,1 Elizabeth A. M. Windsor,1 Alejandro J. Roman,1 Edwin M. Stone,2 and Ian M. MacDonald3  PURPOSE. To characterize in detail the disease expression in choroideremia (CHM), a blinding X-linked disease of the retina caused by loss-of-function mutations in Rab Escort Protein 1 (REP-1). CHM is readily diagnosed in the clinic and by molec- ular testing but has lacked an animal model to test hypotheses and therapeutics. The recent report of a mouse model for CHM prompts the need for reassessment of the human disease in anticipation of treatment initiatives. METHODS. CHM hemizygotes with REP-1 mutations, spanning an age range of 7 decades, were studied with in vivo micros- copy by optical coherence tomography. RESULTS. The disease expression was complex. Earliest stages involved a thickening of the retina that was otherwise normally laminated. Loss of photoreceptors, either independent or as- sociated with retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) depigmenta- tion, was followed by disorganization and further thickening of the retina with interlaminar bridges. The dysmorphic retina then slowly thinned over decades. Laminopathy occurred rst in more peripheral rod-rich regions and later in the cone-rich fovea. CONCLUSIONS. The CHM disease sequence involves detectable retinal thickening, which may be due to Muller cell activation and hypertrophy from photoreceptor stress. Photoreceptor degeneration, RPE depigmentation, and retinal remodeling fol- low. The results represent in vivo evidence in humans for retinal remodeling and provide a marker for the earliest stage of this response to genetic retinal disease. For CHM and other candidate human retinopathies considered for therapy, there is now a framework for making informed decisions about timing, retinal location, and potential value of treatment.

Mosaics of cells of different type, size, and density t together to achieve functional neural circuits that transmit visual information to the brain.1 Among the diseases that dis- rupt this complex adult retinal structure and lead to blindness are a host of inherited retinal degenerations. Molecular heter- ogeneity is characteristic of this disease group.2 A wealth of small and large animal models of the human diseases and increasing preclinical success of somatic gene therapy (for example, Refs. 3 8) have raised expectations that human trials could restore vision in these traditionally incurable forms of genetic blindness.9 11  We were prompted to study an inherited human retinal blindness known as choroideremia (CHM) by the recent report that a long-awaited murine model had been genetically engi- neered.12 That report signals the start of preclinical and clinical work toward human ocular gene therapy for CHM. Compared with other potentially treatable blinding retinal diseases, hu- man CHM holds the advantages of being clinically easy to detect and molecularly homogeneous. Clinical detection of CHM dates back more than a century; the X-linked genetic pattern has been known for at least 50 years13,14; and the molecular basis of disease was discovered approximately 15 years ago.15 CHM is caused by null mutations in Rab Escort Protein 1 (REP-1), a gene involved in the regulation of Rab GTPases and intracellular vesicular transport.16 18  As an early step toward translation to human clinical trials in CHM, we explored the disease expression in CHM hemizygotes, spanning an age range of 7 decades. Unexpected and dramatic retinal abnormalities were found by using in vivo high-resolution optical imaging of the otherwise transparent retina in CHM. The disease sequence suggests major remodeling of the human retina. This report represents in vivo evidence for retinal remodeling in humans and emphasizes the need to investigate in detail the human retinal diseases forming the lengthy queue for gene ther- apy, so that the timing of treatment is appropriate and the poten- tial for efcacy is realistic.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Human Subjects There were 21 CHM hemizygotes representing 15 families. Molecular diagnostics showed that nearly all of these affected males had null alleles in the CHM gene (Table 1; Refs. 18,19). Normal subjects (n  44; ages 5 61 years) were also included. Informed consent was ob- tained after explanation of the nature of the study; procedures com- plied with the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the institutional review board.  En Face Imaging A confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (Heidelberg Retina Angio- gram II, Dossenheim, Germany) was used to image the ocular fundus with infrared (IR) illumination. The contrast of the IR images originates from the interaction of light absorption primarily by RPE pigments and  4113  4114  Jacobson et al.  IOVS, September 2006, Vol. 47, No. 9  TABLE 1.

Wide-eld image montages were assembled from individual images, as previously described.11,20 22 Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans were registered to IR image montages by using retinal landmarks.  Optical Coherence Tomography Cross-sectional retinal reectivity proles were obtained with OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA). The principles of the method and our recording and analysis techniques have been published.11,20 26 Data were acquired with one of two instruments: OCT1 with a theo- retical axial resolution in retinal tissue of 10 m or OCT3 with a resolution of 8 m. In all subjects, overlapping OCT scans of 4.5 mm length were used to cover horizontal and vertical meridians up to 9 mm eccentricity from the fovea. In a subset of patients, dense raster scans were performed to sample an 18  12-mm2 region of the retina centered on the fovea.11,20,21 At least three OCTs were obtained at each retinal location. A video fundus image was acquired and saved with each OCT scan by the commercial software. In addition, the fundus video visible during the complete session was recorded con- tinuously on a video cassette recorder.  Postacquisition processing of OCT data was performed with cus- tom programs (MatLab 6.5; The MathWorks, Natick, MA). Longitudinal reectivity proles (LRPs) making up the OCT scans were aligned by using a dynamic cross-correlation algorithm23 with a manual override when crossing structures (for example, RPE depigmentation; see Fig. 1B), which interrupted local lateral isotropy of signals. At extrafoveal retinal regions, two or three repeated scans were averaged to increase signal-to-noise ratio and allow better denition of retinal laminae.11 At the fovea, a single scan showing the deepest pit was used.  Retinal thickness was dened as the distance between the signal transition at the vitreoretinal interface (labeled T1 in Ref. 23) and major signal peak corresponding to the RPE.20 In normal subjects, the RPE peak was assumed to be the last peak within the two- or three-peaked scattering signal complex (labeled ORCC in Ref. 23) deep in the retina. In patients, the presumed RPE peak was sometimes the only signal peak deep in the retina; other times, it was apposed by other major peaks (see Figs. 1, 2). In the latter case, the RPE peak was specied manually by considering the properties of the backscattering signal originating from layers vitread and sclerad to it. Outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness was dened as the major intraretinal signal trough  delimited by the signal slope maxima and measured as previously described.11 In some patients, ONL thickness was not measurable due to laminopathy (see Figs. 13).  For topographic analysis, the precise location and orientation of each scan relative to retinal features (blood vessels, RPE depigmenta- tion, and optic nerve head) were determined by using the video images of the fundus. LRPs were allotted to 0.3  0.3-mm2 bins in a rectan- gular coordinate system centered at the fovea; the waveforms in each bin were aligned and averaged. The retinal thickness was measured as just described, missing data were interpolated bilinearly, thicknesses were mapped to a pseudocolor scale, and the location of blood vessels and optic nerve head was overlaid for reference.11,21 Lower and upper limits of normal retinal thickness were specied, and the results from patients were subtracted to determine the loci of signicant thickening or thinning.  The local extent of RPE depigmentation was estimated by calculat- ing the sub-RPE backscattering index (sRBI), which was dened as the normalized partial integral of the backscattering signal over retinal depth. The partial integral was performed from the RPE signal peak toward the scleral direction until the noise baseline was reached. The partial integral was divided by the signal intensity at the RPE peak to normalize for the pre-RPE attenuation of the light intensity.  Psychophysics Psychophysical thresholds were measured (1.7 diameter, 200-ms du- ration stimuli spaced at 2 intervals) in the same retinal regions as the OCT scans. Rod function was determined with two-color, dark-adapted perimetry (500- and 650-nm stimuli). Long/medium-wavelength (L/M) cone function was determined with 650-nm stimuli in the dark-adapted state and compared with normal data determined during the cone plateau phase of dark adaptation after a bleach. Details of the visual function techniques and analysis methods have been published.11,19 21,26  RESULTS  Photoreceptor Abnormalities Detected before RPE Depigmentation in CHM Hemizygotes The clinical diagnosis of CHM is made by en face viewing of the fundus. Unlike the normal homogeneous brown-red back- ground of melanin pigment in RPE and choroid, CHM retinas show patchy depigmentation at early disease stages and progress to extensive pigment loss and visibility of yellow- white sclera through transparent retina. In a conditional knock- out of the Chm gene (heterozygous-null female mice), retinal morphology suggest that photoreceptor degeneration and patchy depigmentation of the RPE are independent events.12 Using in vivo cross-sectional optical imaging of the retina in human CHM, we teased apart retinal photoreceptor (PR) from RPE abnormalities, especially focusing on young hemizygotes. Patchy depigmentation and the immediately adjacent pig- mented areas in CHM retinas (Fig. 1A) were sampled by using cross-sectional, high-resolution imaging (Fig. 1B) and com- pared with images from the same retinal locations in normal subjects (Fig. 1C). The laminar organization inside (transparent part of arrows) and outside (opaque part of arrows) of the depigmented areas is illustrated with overlaid reectivity pro- les. Cross-sections from normal retina show discernible lam- inae: there are cellular layers of low reectivity (for example, INL, inner nuclear layer; and ONL) with intervening higher reectivity laminae of synaptic connections. Deep in the retina is the multipeaked signal representing PR inner and outer segments (IS/OS), RPE, and anterior choroid.11,20,21 The depig- mented patches mainly showed increased backscatter signal, originating from deep to the RPE layer, and disturbed lamina- tion of overlying retina. The deep backscatter corresponded well to the retinal extent of depigmentation from the en face view (see arrows between Figs. 1B, and 1C). The immediately  IOVS, September 2006, Vol. 47, No. 9  Remodeling of the Human Retina in Choroideremia  4115  FIGURE 1. Photoreceptor loss pre- cedes RPE depigmentation in human CHM.

This qualitative approach suggested that the selected areas of depigmentation from en face views also had retinal degeneration.  A quantitative approach was then taken to determine whether photoreceptor degeneration and patchy depigmenta- tion of the RPE were always found together in human CHM (Fig. 1D). Parameters representing photoreceptors (ONL thick- ness and rst peak of multipeaked deep retinal signal11,20,21) and RPE depigmentation (sRBI) were measured at three retinal  locations (fovea; 3.6 and 7.8 mm in temporal retina) in young CHM hemizygotes (ages 713). Representative reectivity pro- les at these different retinal loci show the PR and RPE param- eters in a 12-year-old normal subject and P3 at age 11 (Fig. 1D). At the fovea (Fig. 1D, top row), young CHM hemizygotes had photoreceptor and RPE parameters that were within normal limits, calculated from a group of young normal subjects (ages 513). At the 3.6-mm temporal retinal locus (Fig. 1D, middle row), all young hemizygotes had normal RPE. P2 at age 7 had normal PR parameters but P3 and P5 (ages 8 13) had loss of the PR IS/OS signal with normal ONL thickness. At 7.8-mm  4116  Jacobson et al.

P3 at age 11 and P5 at two ages studied (11 and 13 years) showed evidence for both PR and RPE abnormalities. Therefore, in these young hemizygotes there were detectable micropathological PR abnormalities that colocalized with nor- mal or abnormal RPE, but no evidence was found for RPE abnormality with normal PR.  Photoreceptor Loss and Retinal Dysmorphology with Interlaminar Bridges in Rod-Rich Retina Retinal lamination is shown for a normal 8-year-old and a normal 58-year-old at a locus 7.8 mm from the fovea in the temporal retina (Fig. 2A, far left panels). Rod photoreceptors in this region are at a density of approximately 120,000 cells/mm2 and the ratio of rods to cones is 30:1,27 resembling the ratio in murine retina.28 P3 at age 8 years showed a laminar pattern similar to normal with normal ONL thickness but a single rather than mul- tipeaked reectivity from the outer retinaa feature of PR IS/OS disease.11,20,21,23 P5 at age 11 retained laminae but the retina was generally thinner, with the ONL more approximate to the RPE, suggesting loss of PR IS/OS; a high backscatter signal was evident deep to the RPE. P6 at age 13 had lost distinct retinal lamination; there was almost a bilaminar appearance with an intense deep backscatter signal. Representative cross-sectional images at ages 34 (P11, P10) and 56 (P19) show disorganized bilaminar retina that is thin in comparison with normal and to scans from the younger CHM hemizygotes.  Only three young CHM hemizygotes (P2 at age 7; P3 at ages 8 and 11; P5, at age 11) had a retinal laminar pattern that permitted measurement of the ONL at this locus. At 8 years, the results were within normal limits; but, at age 11, P3 and P5 had reduced ONL thickness (Fig. 2B, left). In other young hemizygotes at ages 11 to 13, the retina had lost laminar organization and ONL measurements were not possible (data not shown). PR-mediated vision at this temporal retinal loca- tion indicates minimally or moderately abnormal function at the earliest ages tested and complete loss of sensitivity by about age 13 (Fig. 2B, right). Total retinal thickness at this location presented a data set that contrasted with that of photoreceptor structure and function. There could be normal thickness in many CHM retinas until age 20 years. A slow decline followed over the next 4 decades of life (Fig. 2C). Occasional hyperreective interlaminar bridges were noted between outer and inner retina at this retinal location (Fig. 2D).  Retinal Thickening as a Marker of the Earliest CHM Disease Stage A more central retinal region extending from 2 mm temporal to the fovea was next evaluated. Cross-sectional images showed a spectrum of changes from normal ONL and normal PR IS/OS, to degenerative stages with PR loss, to retinal laminar disorganiza- tion (Fig. 3A). Overlaid reectivity proles are at 1.3 mm temporal to the fovea, where rod photoreceptors are at a density of ap- proximately 80,000 cells/mm2 and the rod-cone ratio is 5:120 (Fig. 3A). P5, at age 11, showed normal PR laminae. At the three other ages of CHM hemizygotes shown, there were PR abnormalities: thinning of the ONL and a single rather than multipeaked outer retinal signal indicating IS/OS disturbances. More temporal to the 1.3-mm location, there were hyperreectivities in the normally hyporeective zone representing ONL and the appearance of laminar disorganization.  ONL layer thickness was measurable at 1.3 mm temporal retina and declined over the rst 4 decades (Fig. 3B); at ages 40 years, the laminar architecture was not distinct enough to be absolutely certain of the ONL. The PR IS/OS signal was lost early in the second decade of life. PR-mediated vision showed  FIGURE 4.

Retinal thickness, in contrast, was either normal or abnormally in- creased in early years and was maintained within the normal limits until late in the third decade of life; thereafter, there was progressive retinal thinning. A feature captured in many of these cross-sectional images during apparent transition from normal to abnormal lamination were the interlaminar bridges of hyperreectivity (Fig. 3D).  Cone-Rich Foveal Thickening Decades before Cone Dysfunction The clinical literature about CHM emphasizes the very long-term preservation of visual acuity.29 Remarkable changes in foveal archi- tecture, however, were observed in our CHM patients over the lengthy course of disease (Fig. 4). At the earliest ages studied, the CHM fovea had normal architecture, but in patients from ages 13 through 40, there could be extreme thickening of the fovea (Fig. 4A). This obliteration of the normal foveal depression persisted in some subjects, but in others there was eventual thinning (Fig. 4A, age 55).  4118  Jacobson et al.

Gray lines in (B) and (C): normal mean  2 SD.  (lled gray)  Foveal thickness was normal in most of the youngest hemizygotes (age 13) and then was notably supernormal over ensuing decades (ages 1338); there was a tendency to decline into the normal range in the fth decade of life and then become subnormal (Fig. 4B). There was no comparable pattern of foveal cone function increase and then decrease with age. Quantitation of foveal cone sensitivity conrmed the clinical literature of a very slow decline in central function over the decades (Fig. 4C).  Spatiotemporal Pattern of Retinal Thickening Topographical maps of retinal thickness and measurements across the horizontal meridian (Figs. 5A, 5B) conrmed and extended the sampled data (Figs. 2 4). In the normal human retina, the foveal pit is the site of highest cone density and is surrounded by a parafoveal annulus of increased thickness; there is a gradual decline in retinal thickness with distance from the parafoveal peak to periphery with the exception of the optic nerve head and nerve ber layers in the nasal retina. In P5, at age 13, the spatial extent of the parafoveal annulus as well as its thickness was abnormally increased. Older hemizy- gotes could show little or no foveal depression, a normal- appearing parafoveal thickness, and a tendency of thinning with eccentricity. Late stages of the disease, exemplied by P17 at age 49, could show a reappearance of the foveal de- pression with a very thinned parafovea and periphery (Fig. 5A). A glimpse of the natural history of retinal thickness change was  obtained from measurements spanning the horizontal meridian in a group of 10 CHM hemizygotes (Fig. 5B). The differences from mean thickness in representative patients of different ages are illustrated, and the retinal regions with supernormal and subnormal thickness are highlighted; normal limits repre- sent 2 SD from the mean (Fig. 5C). In the rst decade of life, retinal thickness could be normal. Early in the second decade of life, a parafoveal region of abnormally increased thickness became evident. P5 at age 11 illustrates this parafoveal abnor- mality; there was normal thickness in the more peripheral retina. In the second through fourth decades of life, foveal thickening was frequently observed and there was loss of the foveal pit; the parafovea could be normal in thickness, but there was thinning with increasing eccentricity. P10 at age 34 illustrated the foveal thickening and peripheral thinning. In later decades, there was generalized thinning of central as well as peripheral retina (Figs. 5B, 5C).  DISCUSSION  Neuronal damage in the mature central nervous system elicits complex remodeling responses of neurons and glia.30 32 Reti- nal remodeling has been documented in postmortem human donor retinas affected with retinal degeneration33,34 and in studies of animal retinas in response to genetic and traumatic diseases.3538 Interest in retinal remodeling has heightened as  IOVS, September 2006, Vol. 47, No. 9  Remodeling of the Human Retina in Choroideremia  4119  GCL  INL  ONL  IS/OS RPE  FIGURE 6.

The question often posed is how such changes in retinal structure, so well demonstrated in animals, would alter or limit approaches to treatment in humans. A more fundamental and unanswered question is whether retinal remodeling can even be detected in vivo in human retinal degenerations. Until the present study, this question has not been asked.  Our disease analysis of CHM, a candidate retinal blindness for gene therapy, led to the unexpected observation of dra- matic alterations in the laminar organization of these retinas. The spectrum and sequence of abnormalities we observed in CHM retinas most likely represent in vivo evidence of remod- eling of the human retina in retinal degeneration. The earliest nding was retinal thickening that anticipated or coincided with photoreceptor abnormalities. Of course, there are many possible explanations for retinal thickening. In the context of our entire data set, however, we propose that this thickening is a surrogate marker for the earliest stages of remodeling and that the pathobiology underlying this disease expression in- volves the Muller cell, the main glial cell of the retina. The radially oriented Muller cells span the retinal depth, contact most neurons, serve a multitude of functions, and are distrib- uted across the primate and human retina including the fo- vea.39  43 Activation of glial cells after neuronal injury, whether genetic or traumatic, is a common feature of central nervous system and retinal diseases.30,32,44 Muller cell activation has even been noted as a presage to photoreceptor loss in aging rats.45 A signaling pathway between injured photoreceptors and Muller cells has recently been elucidated.44 We suggest that photoreceptor stress or damage (either primary or second- ary to RPE disease) in CHM leads to Muller cell activation, hypertrophy, or possibly proliferation, and this effect is detect- able as retinal thickening by in vivo cross-sectional imaging. The tell-tale optical features of radially oriented hyperreective bridges extending between laminae may represent activated and hypertrophied Muller cell clusters with an altered pheno- type that changes the optical properties in cross section. The high density of Muller cells in the parafovea of the primate retina may explain the pronounced thickening near the fovea; in the fovea, Muller cells are the only cell type other than cone photoreceptors.39,42,46 Other possible contributing sources to retinal thickening could be intracellular edema of neuronal or glial cells, as suggested by studies of neurotrophic factors in retinal degenerations.47 49  Beyond these earlier stages, there is photoreceptor dysfunc- tion and death and loss of normal retinal lamination. Taking previous work in animal retinas3537 together with our in vivo results, a simplied model involving four major disease stages of CHM can be described (Fig. 6). According to this model, the earliest detectable abnormality is a thickened retina with nor- mal lamination and normal function (stage I). Disease becomes clinically overt with loss of photoreceptor nuclei, shortening of IS/OS, and depigmentation of RPE (stages II and III). The latest disease stage (stage IV) of CHM is a thinned retina with neu- ronal cell death and loss of laminar architecture, with gliosis. Stage IV retina without discrete laminae in blind regions of CHM retina would probably also show the complex reorgani- zation described in the many histopathological studies of other retinopathies 3338 Of interest, in human retinopathies caused by mutations in NR2E3 and CRB1, we also observed dysplastic- appearing retina but with topographies different from that in CHM.20,21 A parsimonious explanation is that retinal remodel- ing plays a key role in all three disorders; further studies should tell whether most human retinopathies with photoreceptor loss undergo a stereotypical retinal remodeling disease se- quence as occurs in many rodent retinopathies.35,37  What is the clinical relevance of the current results? An in vivo surrogate marker of the earliest disease stages of retinal remodeling and characterization of later stages should be valuable in the timing of future interventions in CHM as well as in other retinal degenerations that may share these features. For example, late-stage delaminated and thinned retina would obviously not be a candidate region for an intervention intended to restore vision by gene replacement. Regions with retinal thickening but little or no measurable photoreceptor loss may be candidate areas for therapy designed to preserve retina. The latest stage of retinal remodeling at which an intervention would reverse this cascade is unknown but can be tested experimentally in other animal retinal degenerations documented to involve such changes.35,37 Of interest, the literature on experimental retinal de- tachment indicates that Muller cell hypertrophy is inhibited by reat- tachment, but some aspects of Muller cell behavior are not re- versed.50 Recognition that progression to blindness in CHM may result not only from the abnormal REP-1 pathway but also from secondary neuronal death and corrupted retinal circuitry due to irreversible negative effects of remodeling35,37 should advocate for early intervention in a disease so readily diagnosed clinically and molecularly.  4120  Jacobson et al.

We have previously identied a full-length L1 insertion in the CHM (choroideremia) gene of a patient with choroideremia, an X-linked progressive eye disease. Because this L1 element, designated L1CHM, contains two 30-transductions, we were able to delineate a retrotransposition path in which a precursor L1 on chromosome 10p15 or 18p11 retrotransposed to chromosome 6p21 and subsequently to the CHM gene on chromosome Xq21. A cell cul- ture retrotransposition assay showed that L1CHM is one of the most active L1 elements in the human genome. Most importantly, analysis of genomic DNA from the CHM patients relatives indicated somatic and germ-line mosaicism for the L1 insertion in his mother. These ndings provide evidence that L1 retrotransposition can occur very early in human embryonic development.  INTRODUCTION  LINE-1 (long interspersed nuclear elements-1) or L1 elements are the most abundant autonomous retrotransposons in the human genome, accounting for 17% of its mass. Although the vast majority of L1s are functionally inactive, 80 to 100 L1 elements remain capable of retrotransposition in the average human genome (1). Most of these active L1s belong to the transcribed group a (Ta) subset and are polymorphic with respect to their presence or absence and retrotrans- position capability (2,3). A functional L1 element measures 6 kb and consists of a 50-untranslated region (UTR) with internal promoter activity, two open-reading frames (ORFs) and a 30-UTR with a polyadenylation signal followed immedi- ately by a poly(A) tail (4). Retrotransposition of L1 elements  involves transcription, reverse transcription and integration into a new genomic location. Reverse transcription and integration occur in a coupled reaction termed target-primed reverse transcription (5). L1 retrotransposons have altered the human genome through a variety of mechanisms other than their own mobilization (reviewed in 6). L1 elements can trans- port downstream anking DNA to a new genomic location in a process called 30-transduction. This occurs when the L1 poly- adenylation signal is bypassed in favor of a downstream poly- adenylation site (7  9). L1s are potential generators of genomic deletions (10,11).  At present, information about either the timing or the cell- type specicity of human L1 retrotransposition events is limited. In vitro studies have demonstrated that a variety of human transformed or immortalized cultured cells can  *To whom correspondence should be addressed at: Department of Human Genetics 855, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, PO Box 9101, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

Structure and origin of L1CHM. A schematic representation of L1CHM integrated in exon 6 of the CHM gene on chromosome Xq21 is shown on the top. The L1 element is surrounded by a 14 bp target site duplication (TSD1). The two ORFs (ORF1, ORF2) and three poly(A) stretches interrupted by two transduced sequences (positions 6079 6197 and positions 6212 6617) of L1CHM are indicated. In the middle, the 30-UTR of L1CHM is expanded and aligned with an allelic variant of its precursor L1 in contig AC004200.1 on chromosome 6p21. This L1 element is anked by a 15 bp target site duplication (TSD2). Possible pre-integration sites of the precursor to the L1CHM precursor on chromosome 10p15 and 18p11 are indicated at the bottom.  accommodate retrotransposition (12  14). In addition, a recent report documented retrotransposition of a human L1 element both in cultured rat neural progenitor cells and in the brain of transgenic mice (15). Also, an L1 insertion disrupting the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC ) gene has been identied in a colorectal tumor, but was absent in the surrounding con- stitutional tissue of the patient (16). It thus seems that L1 ret- rotransposons can mobilize in some somatic cells. However, L1 elements can only propagate and expand if retrotransposi- tions occur in primordial germ cells, their derivatives in the germ line or early in embryonic development. A mouse model for human L1 retrotransposition (17) and the investi- gation of a disease-producing L1 insertion into the cytochrome b(2245) beta subunit gene (18) have indicated that L1 retro- transposition can occur during meiosis I in both male and female germ cells. An insertion of an engineered human L1 element at an early stage in development of a transgenic mouse has also been reported (19). It should be noted, however, that transcription of this L1 transgene was under the control of the mouse RNA polymerase II large subunit pro- moter in addition to its endogenous promoter.  L1 retrotransposons can cause hereditary diseases by inte- grating into genes (20,21 and references therein). Previously, we identied an L1 insertion in the CHM gene of a Dutch patient diagnosed with choroideremia [CHM (MIM303100)], an X-linked progressive eye disorder. The L1 was integrated into exon 6 in reverse orientation, leading to aberrant splicing of the CHM mRNA (22). Interestingly, this L1 element, desig- nated L1CHM, appeared to be full-length, which prompted us to characterize it in detail. L1CHM contains two 30-transduced sequences that allowed us to infer its retrotransposition path. We also demonstrate that L1CHM is highly active, but more  importantly, we present data indicating that the actual L1 insertion into the CHM gene took place during early embryo- genesis in the patients mother.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Retrotransposition path of L1CHM  L1CHM was PCR-amplied from genomic DNA of the CHM patient using primers anking exon 6 of the CHM gene. Subsequent sequence analysis of the PCR product was per- formed with primers derived from a consensus sequence of active human L1 elements. L1CHM has a length of 6688 bp and is surrounded by a perfect 14 bp TSD (50-AGAAG ATCAATTAG-30, designated TSD1 in Fig. 1). The 30-UTR contains the ACA sequence (positions 5922  5924) diagnostic for the Ta subset (23). At its 30-end, L1CHM contains three poly(A) stretches of 60, 14 and 71 nucleotides, respectively, interrupted by transduced sequences of 119 and 406 bp (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). These 30-transductions are indicative of multiple rounds of retrotransposition.  sequence  database  A transduced sequence acts as a molecular address that permits the identication of the precursor to the transduction event. A BLAST search (24) of the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov) showed that the 406 bp transduction of L1CHM is a precise match to sequences and AC004200.1 (GenBank) on chromosome 6p21. BX005091.7 lacks an L1 element and represents the pre-integration site. A 6212 bp L1 is located immediately 50 of the 406 bp sequence in AC004200.1 (Fig. 1). This L1 is identical in sequence to L1CHM (1  6211) except for three additional  from BX005091.7 (EMBL)  D o w n l o a d e d       f r o m h t t p : / / h m g  .  o x f o r d j o u r n a l s . o r g /   b y     g u e s t       o n F e b r u a r y     1 8  ,    2 0 1 5  Human Molecular Genetics, 2007, Vol. 16, No. 13  1589  D o w n l o a d e d       f r o m h t t p : / / h m g  .  o x f o r d j o u r n a l s . o r g /   b y     g u e s t       o n F e b r u a r y     1 8  ,    2 0 1 5  Figure 2. Fundus images of the CHM patient (II.1), his mother (I.2) and carrier sister (II.2). Numbers correspond to the pedigree in Fig. 3A. The mother (I.2) has a normal fundus with a few choroidal hyperpigmentations in the midperiphery (arrowheads). The patient (II.1) shows the hallmarks of CHM: extensive mid- peripheral atrophy of the RPE and choroid, leading to a hypopigmented fundus while sparing its center till the end-stage, together with attenuated retinal vessels (arrowheads). Carrier female II.2 shows atrophy around the optic disc (left panel, arrowhead) and so-called pepper and salt pigment changes with hyper- pigmentations in the equatorial region (right panel, arrowheads).  guanine residues at its 50-end, a single nucleotide change in ORF2 (T position 28 485 versus C in L1CHM position 2439), and a poly(A) stretch of 58 instead of 60 adenosine residues. As in L1CHM, a 119 bp transduced sequence followed by a poly(A) stretch of 14 nucleotides is present at the 30-end. The L1 element is anked by a perfect 15 bp TSD (50-AAAA AACACAGTGAA-30, designated TSD2 in Fig. 1). Thus, the L1 in AC004200.1 and the precursor to L1CHM are likely to be alleles at a locus on chromosome 6p21, and this locus is polymorphic as to the presence or absence of an L1 element. Indeed, it has previously been established that an L1 element is present at this locus in 0 to 4% of alleles from different human populations (1,2).  A BLAT search (25) of the UCSC genome database [http:// genome.ucsc.edu, Human May 2004 (hg17) assembly] using the 119 bp transduction of L1CHM and its precursor pro- duced exact matches near the telomeres of the short arms of chromosome 10 (10p15.3 nucleotides g.60 462  g.60 344) and chromosome 18 (18p11.32 nucleotides g.14 856  g.14 738). No full-length L1 element is present. Likewise, a BLAST search (24) of the NCBI non-redundant nucleo- tide sequence database (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov) revealed no sequences in which the 119 bp segment was preceded by  the precursor to the L1CHM precursor may an L1. Thus, reside on either chromosome 10pter or 18pter. PCR analysis of these regions in 200 Dutch individuals failed to detect an L1 element. This indicates that the presumed L1 element at 10p15 or 18p11 is very rare or no longer present in this popu- lation, although a technical problem cannot be excluded. Taken together, these ndings indicate a scenario in which an L1 on chromosome 6p21 retrotransposed into the CHM gene on chromosome Xq21. The L1 element on chromosome 6p21 in turn is derived from either chromosome 10p15 or chromosome 18p11.  L1CHM displays high retrotransposition activity  L1CHM was tested in an established cultured cell assay that uses an enhanced green uorescent protein (EGFP) marker to determine retrotransposition activity (1,26). L1RP, an L1 element that was discovered as a de novo insertion into the retinitis pigmentosa 2 gene (27,28), served as a standard for comparison in this assay. The retrotransposition activity of L1CHM was about one-third that of L1RP, classifying L1CHM as a highly active or hot L1 (1). Hot L1s comprise only a  1590  Human Molecular Genetics, 2007, Vol. 16, No. 13  small proportion of active L1s but are responsible for the majority of retrotransposition in the human population.  Somatic and germ-line mosaicism for L1CHM  In order to determine when the L1 insertion into the CHM gene took place, the relatives of the CHM patient were studied. CHM exhibits an X-linked mode of inheritance. Males affected with CHM experience night blindness, fol- lowed by progressive visual eld loss leading to tunnel vision and often blindness. These symptoms are paralleled by degeneration of the choroid and retina, beginning in the midperiphery and gradually progressing toward the macula (29). Figure 2 shows a fundus photograph of the patient (II.1) demonstrating the extensive chorioretinal hypopigmen- tation with preservation of pigment in the central macula that is typical for CHM. Female CHM carriers generally have no serious visual impairment. They can, however, be diagnosed by fundoscopic examination as they manifest patchy areas of chorioretinal degeneration resulting from X chromosome inactivation. Ophthalmological examination of the patients mother (I.2) revealed three hyperpigmented radial lines in the temporal inferior part of the right fundus but was otherwise unremarkable (Fig. 2). One of the patients sisters (II.2) showed normal optic discs, marked peripapillary atrophy in zones alpha and beta, a hypopigmented fundus with some white ecks in the periphery, slight pepper and salt pigment alterations in the peripheral retina and hyperpigmen- ted equatorial rings and streaks (Fig. 2). She was diagnosed as a carrier. Apart from changes consistent with her myopia, the patients other sister (II.3) had a normal fundus appearance (not shown).  the family for  Initial genotyping of  two polymorphic markers within the CHM gene, i.e. a single-nucleotide poly- morphism (c.351G/A) in exon 5 (30) and a microsatellite marker in intron 9 (31), showed that the patient and his two sisters share the disease haplotype (Fig. 3A). For female II.3, this was inconsistent with her clinical examination. Therefore, the presence of the L1CHM insertion in the family members was investigated using a PCR assay that amplied the mutant CHM allele containing the L1CHM insertion and the normal CHM allele. Both alleles were found in lymphocyte-derived DNA from the mother but the mutant PCR product had a signicantly reduced level compared with the normal PCR product (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the mother is a somatic mosaic for the L1 insertion. PCR analysis further showed that female II.2 is heterozygous for the L1 insertion, whereas female II.3 has only the normal CHM allele (Fig. 3B). The nding that female II.3 inherited the at-risk haplotype but not the L1CHM insertion proves that the mother is a germ-line mosaic. Thus, these data demon- strate that the L1 retrotransposition took place in the patients mother. A precursor to L1CHM is actually present on one of her 6p21 alleles (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2). Since the patients mother shows both somatic and germ-line mosai- cism for the L1 insertion into the CHM gene, the L1 retrotran- sposition early embryogenesis, before the germ-line segregated from the somatic lineages.  during  event must  have  occurred  D o w n l o a d e d       f r o m h t t p : / / h m g  .  o x f o r d j o u r n a l s . o r g /   b y     g u e s t       o n F e b r u a r y     1 8  ,    2 0 1 5  Figure 3.

(32) report that human embryonic stem cells express endogenous L1 elements and can accommodate L1 retrotransposition in vitro. In reinforcement of these data, our detailed analysis of a disease-causing L1 insertion provides in vivo evidence that L1 retrotransposition can occur very early in human embryo- nic development.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Molecular characterization of L1CHM  L1CHM was amplied from genomic DNA of the CHM patient with the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche) using primers anking exon 6 (50-CGGAGGACTGGAATTTAC TGCTTTATGA-30 and 50-GAATTTCAGCTAATCAATTCT GAGCCTG-30) as described (22). The PCR product was puri- ed with Qiaquick columns (Qiagen). Sequence analysis was performed using primers derived from a consensus sequence of active human L1 elements (adapted from 28). Primer sequences are available upon request. Sequencing reactions were carried out by the use of BigDye Terminator chemistry according to the guidelines provided by the manufacturer (PE Applied Biosystems) and analyzed on an ABI 3700 capil- lary DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems).  Human Molecular Genetics, 2007, Vol. 16, No. 13  1591  Molecular analysis of possible L1CHM precursor loci  SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL  To investigate the presence of a precursor L1 element at 10p15/18p11, a primer derived from the 30-UTR of L1CHM (50-CCTAATGCTAGATGACACA-30) and a primer specic for both 10p15 and 18p11 (50-AAATGCTTGAGAGGAT GG-30) were used. The expected size of the PCR fragment is 446 bp. The empty allele at 10p15/18p11 was ampli- ed using primers 50-AAATGCTTGAGAGGATGG-30 and 50-TGGGATGAGCAATGAATAAC-30 (272 bp product).  Retrotransposition assay Primer 50-ATTTCGCCGGCGTTGATTAGAAGATCAATTA GCCTCCTCGGTTC-30 containing a NotI site and primer 50-ATACATATGTACACGGTACGACCACGCGA-30 con- taining a BstZ17I site were used for PCR amplication of L1CHM from the patients genomic DNA by Expand Long Template PCR (Roche) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The PCR product was digested with NotI and BstZ17I and swapped into pL1RP  EGFP, a previously published construct containing L1RP tagged with an EGFP retrotransposition cassette (1,18). Then pL1CHM  EGFP was assayed for its ability to retrotranspose in cultured human 143B TK-osteosarcoma cells, as described (1,26), using pL1RP  EGFP as a standard for comparison.  Clinical and molecular genetic analysis of the CHM family  The patient and his relatives were examined by fundoscopy and functional ophthalmological methods. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood lymphocytes by a salt extraction pro- cedure (33). Genotyping for a single-nucleotide polymorphism (c.351G/A) in exon 5 (30) was carried out by PCR amplica- tion with primers derived from intron 5 (50-AGCCTGGTGT TTATTATTATATT-30) and intron 6 (50-GCAAAGATGGGT AAAATTAGT-30). PCR products were puried with Qiaquick columns (Qiagen) and sequenced as described above. Analysis of a microsatellite marker in intron 9 was performed using a 6-FAM-labeled forward primer (50-TCAGTACAG TGCCTTGTAGTGGA-30) and an unlabeled reverse primer (50-GTTGATATGTTATTAATACCAAGGAG-30) as descri- bed previously (31). To investigate the presence of the L1CHM insertion, a PCR assay amplifying both the mutant allele containing L1CHM and the normal CHM allele was designed. For the PCR amplication of mutant CHM allele primers derived from intron 6 (50-CGGAGGACTG GAATTTACTGCTTTATGA-30) and the 50-UTR of L1CHM (50-TGCTCTCTTCAAAGCTGTCAGACAG-30) were used, whereas the normal CHM allele was amplied with intronic primers anking exon 6 (50-CGGAGGACTGGAATTTAC TGCTTTATGA-30 and 50-GAATTTCAGCTAATCAATTCT GAGCCTG-30). The PCR reaction mixture contained 1 PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 400 nM of primers, 250 ng of genomic DNA and 1 unit Taq polymerase (Invitro- gen). After 2 min at 948C, 35 cycles were carried out consisting of 20 s at 948C, 20 s at 568C and 1 min at 728C, followed by 2 min at 728C. PCR products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.  Supplementary Material is available at HMG Online.

Zenteno1,3* 1Research Unit, Institute of Ophthalmology Conde De Valenciana, Mexico City, Mexico 2Department of Retina, Institute of Ophthalmology Conde De Valenciana, Mexico City, Mexico 3Department of Genetics, Institute of Ophthalmology Conde De Valenciana, Mexico City, Mexico  Received 1 April 2008; Accepted 17 December 2008  Choroideremia is an X-linked recessive retinal dystrophy characterized by progressive loss of the photoreceptor, the retinal pigment epithelium, and the choriocapillaris layers which ultimately can result in blindness by the fth decade of life. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene CHM, which encodes a protein involved in the regulation of intracellular vesicular trafc. Typically, hemizygous males are affected by the disease and female carriers are asymptomatic with only a diffuse mottled pattern of hyperpigmentation on funduscopy. Uncommon in- stances of fully affected females have been described previously and these cases are proposed to arise from an skewed Lyonization mechanism preferentially inactivating the X chromosome car- rying the normal CHM allele. In this work, the clinical and molecular features of two Mexican families with choroideremia are described. A novel and a previously described CHM mutation were identied. X-chromosome inactivation assays were per- formed in a total of 12 heterozygous carriers from the two families. In an affected female from family A, a random X-inactivation pattern was demonstrated; on the other hand, in a female carrier from family B displaying a conspicuous pattern of pigment epithelium mottling at the peripheral retina, a skewed X-inactivation pattern was found. However, the X-chro- mosome preferentially inactivated in this female was the one carrying the mutated allele. Our results add to the genotypic spectrum in choroideremia and does not support a correlation between X-inactivation status and abnormal retinal phenotype in heterozygous female carriers from these two families.  2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Heterozygous females have no or milder symptoms associ- ated with funduscopically evident patchy areas of chorioretinal degeneration [Karna, 1986; Heckenlively and Bird, 1988; Flannery et al., 1990; Rudolph et al., 2003], presumably related to the pattern of X-chromosome inactivation [Flannery et al., 1990; MacDonald et al., 1997]. However, exceptional carrier females fully affected by choroideremia have been also described [Shapira and Sitney, 1943; Fraser and Friedmann, 1968; Karna, 1986; Majid et al., 1998; Endo et al., 2000; Renner et al., 2006], these cases apparently arising due to non-random or skewed X-chromosome lyonization preferentially inactivating the chromosome carrying the normal allele [Jay, 1985; Potter et al., 2004].  INTRODUCTION  Choroideremia (OMIM #303100) is an X-linked recessive degene- rative disease of the retina characterized by a progressive centripetal loss of the photoreceptor, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and the choriocapillaris layers [Krill and Archer, 1971].

REP1 is critical for the posttranslational lipid modication and subsequent membrane targeting of Rab proteins, small GTP- binding proteins that act as key regulators of intracellular vesicular trafc [Seabra et al., 1992; Alexandrov et al., 1994].  The majority of CHM gene mutations identied to date in choroideremia patients from different ethnicities are point muta- tions that directly introduce a premature stop codon [van den Hurk et al., 1997, 2003; Beaufrere et al., 1999; McTaggart et al., 2002]; Other CHM defects as deletions (partial or total), translocations, insertions, and intronic mutations causing splice defects, have also been recognized in some patients [Sankila et al., 1992; van den Hurk et al., 2003; Yip et al., 2007]. CHM missense mutations have not been yet identied, suggesting that these changes are either embry- onic lethal or have no or very mild phenotypic effects.  In this article we describe the clinical and molecular analyses of two Mexican families with choroideremia. A novel and a previously described nonsense mutations in CHM were identied. The X-chromosome inactivation pattern was investigated in 12 carrier females from these two families, including a severely affected female individual. Our results add to the genotypic spectrum in choroi- deremia and do not support a role for X-chromosome inactivation pattern in determining the fundus phenotype in heterozygous CHM females.  PATIENTS AND METHODS  Two Mexican Mestizo families, A and B, were included in the study. No history of immigration ancestry or consanguinity was recorded in any pedigree.  Ophthalmologic Studies Ophthalmologic examinations included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) determination, slit-lamp and dilated fundus examination, applanation tonometry, fundus phothography, Farnsworth-Munsell chromatic test, electroretinogram (ERG), uorescein retinal angiography (FA), Goldmann kinetic perimetry (GKP), and contrast sensitivity tests. All affected subjects under- went systemic evaluation by a geneticist to exclude associated somatic anomalies. The patients were recruited from the Depart- ment of Retina of our institution. ERGs were performed according to standards from the International Society for Clinical Electro- physiology of Vision.  Molecular Analyses  CHM gene analysis. After obtaining local Ethics Committee approval and Informed Consent from patients or their parents, blood samples were drawn by venipuncture, and genomic DNA was extracted using the Puregene DNA Purication Kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). PCR amplication of the complete coding region of the CHM gene (15 exons) was achieved using pairs of primers and temperatures available on request. Each 25 ml PCR amplication reaction contained 1X buffer, 200 ng of genomic  DNA, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 2U Taq polymerase, 1 mM of forward and reverse primers, and 1.5 mM MgCl2. PCR products were ana- lyzed in 1.5% agarose gels from which the bands with the amplied templates were excised, and the DNA subsequently puried with the help of the Qiaex II kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Direct automated sequencing of CHM was performed with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), adding about 15 ng of template DNA in each reaction and using a temperature program that included 25 cycles of denatura- tion at 97C for 30 sec, annealing at 50C for 15 sec, and extension at 60C for 4 min. Samples were analyzed in an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Wild-type and mutated CHM sequences were compared manually.  X-chromosome inactivation pattern. The pattern of X-chro- mosome inactivation was determined using the androgen receptor (AR) polymorphic triplet assay described by Allen et al. [1992]. The AR gene contains a highly polymorphic CAG repeat in the rst exon and methylation of CpG sites close to this repeat correlates with X- chromosome inactivation status as those sites are methylated only in the inactive X chromosome and resist cleavage by methylation- sensitive restriction enzymes. Thus, a PCR product is obtained only from the inactive X chromosome. In females heterozygous for the polymorphic AR repeat, this assay allows the distinction between the maternal and paternal alleles and identies their methylation status. Briey, two parallel reactions were set for each DNA sample: in the rst, 2 mg DNA was digested with 20U of HpaII restriction enzyme; in the second, 2 mg DNA was incubated only with the enzyme digestion buffer containing no enzyme. PCR products were run in an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic analyzer and analyzed by means of the GeneScan software. The ratios of X-inactivation were calcu- lated using peak height ratios determined by the built-in software. The X-inactivation pattern was classied as random (allele ratios 50:5065:35), moderately skewed (ratios 65:3580:20), highly skewed (ratios 80:2090:10) and extremely skewed (ratios 90:10100:0), as previously established [Orstavik et al., 1996; Satoh et al., 2008].  RESULTS Clinical Examination Family A was composed of 18 subjects: 3 affected males, 1 affected female, 6 carrier females, 6 healthy males, and 2 non-carrier females. Family B was composed of 9 subjects: 2 affected males, 6 carrier females, and 1 non-carrier female. No associated physical anomalies or hypoacusia were recognized in any affected subject or obligate carrier from both families. Nyctalopia was the initial symptom in affected males from both families with ages of onset between 7 and 10 years in family A, and between 15 and 20 years in family B. Visual acuity (VA) in affected subjects from family A ranged from 20/20 to light perception with no color discrimination while both affected individuals from family B had a 20/20 VA. All affected males from both families in whom color tests could be performed demon- strated a tritanopic pattern. Funduscopic and uorangiographic features were consistent with choroideremia diagnosis. Diffuse chorioretinal atrophy with sparing of the macula was observed at the posterior pole of the eye in affected males (Figs. 1A and 2A).

Funduscopic examination in patient #1 from family A (ID #258), a 70-year-old female with a 20/30 (OD) and 20/20 (OS) VA, revealed extensive choroidal atrophic areas, visualization of choroidal vessels and sclera and sparing of macular region (Fig. 1B), a retinal phenotype similar to that observed in affected males. FAG changes also closely resembled those observed in hemizygous CHM males (Fig. 1C). ERG demonstrated a barely registrable rod system response along with a moderately diminished one in the cone system. Finally, a 24-year-old female carrier from family B (ID #389) demonstrated  a conspicuous pattern of pigment epithelium mottling mainly located at the peripheral retina (Fig. 2B).  CHM Gene Molecular Analyses CHM gene analysis in affected subjects from family A disclosed a C to T transition at nucleotide position 808 (the rst base of the ATG initiation codon is denoted nucleotide 1) in exon 6, which predicts a nonsense R270X mutation (Fig. 1D). This mutation has been described before in several choroideremia subjects from different ethnic backgrounds [Fujiki et al., 1999; van den Hurk et al., 2003;  2138  Family A  A A A A A A B B B B B  AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART A  TABLE I.

Renner et al., 2006]. In affected males from family B, a C to G transversion was demonstrated at nucleotide position 1403 in exon 11, which predicts a S468X non-sense mutation (Fig. 2D). This is a previously undescribed CHM mutation and predicts a prematurely truncated REP1 protein. No other CHM defects were recognized in the remaining CHM exons of affected males from the two families. Direct sequence analysis allows the recognition of a number of heterozygous carrier females, non-carrier females, and healthy males in both pedigrees.  X-Chromosome Inactivation Studies in Carrier Females A total of 13 heterozygous females from both families were identi- ed by sequencing the CHM gene. Twelve of these, 7 from family A and 5 from family B, were heterozygous for the AR polymorphism assay, so the maternal and paternal X-chromosomes were readily  recognized by GeneScan analysis. X-chromosome inactivation studies indicated that 11 out of these 12 female carriers had a random X-chromosome inactivation pattern ranging from 39% to 61% with a mean of 47:53 (%) in family A (n 7) and from 40% to 60% with a mean of 46:54 in family B (n 4) (Table II). An affected female patient from family A (ID #258), who exhibited a fundus eye phenotype comparable to diseased males, had a random pattern of X-chromosome inactivation (52:48, Table II and Fig. 1E). A fth carrier female from family B (ID #389, 24-year-old) exhibited a skewed 68:32 X-chromosome inactivation ratio in two independent assays (Table II and Fig. 2E). Funduscopic analysis in this patient revealed a conspicuous pattern of pigment epithelium mottling mainly located at the peripheral retina (Fig. 2B). Further analysis disclosed, however, that the preferentially inactivated X chromo- some in this patient was the mutation-carrying X-chromosome. Thus, no correlation between phenotypic status and X-inactivation pattern could be established in these two atypical females. Digested  TABLE II.

DISCUSSION  This is the rst report of molecular analysis in Mexican patients with choroideremia and of the X-inactivation pattern in female carriers from this population. Choroideremia is an inherited X-linked reces- sive retinal disease with a calculated incidence of 1 in 50,000100,000 [van den Hurk et al., 1997] and accounts to up to 4% of inherited blindness. Although typically only males are affected by the disease, several cases of manifesting choroideremia females have been re- ported [Shapira and Sitney, 1943; Fraser and Friedmann, 1968; Karna, 1986; Majid et al., 1998; Endo et al., 2000; Renner et al., 2006]. The most reasonable explanation for the occurrence of choroideremia manifesting heterozygous females is an unfavorable or skewed X-lyonization mechanism inactivating preferentially the X chromosome carrying the normal CHM allele with the mutant allele expressing in the majority of retinal cells [Jay, 1985; Cheung et al., 2004; Potter et al., 2004]. In this study we performed molecular investigation of the CHM gene in two Mexican families with the disease and analyzed the pattern of X-chromosome inactivation in a number of heterozygous female carriers, including one manifesting female. Two distinct CHM gene mutations were identied in the two families analyzed here. In family A, a non-sense R270X mutation was demonstrated in hemizygous males and heterozygous females. This REP1 mutation has been previously reported in a number of choroideremia patients indicating that it is a recurrent mutation probably arising independently several times in distinct populations [Fujiki et al., 1999; van den Hurk et al., 2003; Renner et al., 2006]. In family B, a novel non-sense S468X REP1 change was identied. This mutation is located at the COOH extreme of the critical GDI (Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor) REP1domain.  The age of onset of symptoms reported was different in the two families with a mean age of onset of 8.5 and 17.5 years in family A and B, respectively. Unfortunately, clinical details from previous choroideremia cases due the REP1 R270X mutation were omitted in most reports, so a comparative clinical analysis with our patients can not be made. In addition to a late onset of visual symptoms in the subjects carrying the novel S468X mutation, they also exhibit minimal decrease of visual acuity at age of evaluation. Altogether, these data indicate that the R468X mutation is probably associated to a milder choroideremia phenotype.  A choroideremia manifesting heterozygous female was identied in this study. In family A, a patient aged 70 years (ID #258) exhibited clinical, ERG and FAG features comparable to those observed in affected choroideremia males. Analysis of her X-chromosome inac- tivation pattern did not demonstrate skewed or unfavorable inacti- vation (i.e., a random X-chromosome inactivation pattern was established). Conversely, a 24-year-old carrier female from family B (ID #389) which exhibited a conspicuous mottled pattern of hyperpigmentation/hypopigmentation in retina and areas of choriocapillaris atrophy was demonstrated to have a skewed (68:32) pattern of X chromosome inactivation. Further analyses disclosed however that the X chromosome that was preferentially inactivated in her leukocytes was the one carrying the mutated CHM gene allele. Taking these two cases, it is apparent that, at least in the  two families analyzed here, a non-random pattern of X-chromosome inactivation is not associated with an abnormal retinal phenotype in heterozygous choroideremia females.  Because the choice of one or the other X chromosome early in the process of X inactivation is generally random [Lyon, 1961], the expected mean X-inactivation pattern of the paternally and mater- nally inherited X chromosomes is 50:50. Preferential inactivation of the normal CHM allele has been proposed as the source of hetero- zygous choroideremia females manifesting the disease. Our results in this work do not support a role for X-inactivation in determining the retinal phenotypes in the two families described here. However, it is possible that the pattern of X-inactivation in the cells we studied (i.e., peripheral leukocytes) does not correspond to that in the choroideremia target cells (i.e., photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelium cells).  Other factors could also explain the results found in our study. For example, previous observations in cell lines have demonstrated that the expression of CHM is heterogeneous as monoallelic expression, consistent with X inactivation, can be detected in some cell lines, whereas biallelic expression, indicating escape from X inactivation, is detected in others [Carrel and Willard, 1999]. Furthermore, in cell lines in which CHM is expressed from the inactive X chromosome, the level of expression relative to the active X levels is reduced [Carrel and Willard, 1999]. These important differences in CHM X-inactivation pattern could account for the apparent lack of genotypephenotype correlation observed in our study.  A female aged 70 years from family A demonstrated a fundu- scopic appearance comparable to Choroideremia hemyzigous males. Symptomatic choroideremia carrier females of advanced age have been reported previously [Syed et al., 2001; Yau et al., 2007] and taking into account the progressive loss of photoreceptor cells in choroideremia, it is possible that funduscopic appearance wor- sens in heterozygous females with age [Yau et al., 2007]. Similarly, it is interesting to make note that there is evidence in normal females that skewed X-chromosome inactivation appears to be more pro- nounced after age 30 than at younger ages, suggesting that allele- specic loss of methylation with time results in an increased X- chromosome inactivation skewing [Hatakeyama et al., 2004]. Similar ndings have also been demonstrated in mice [Bennett- Baker et al., 2003]. In conjunction these two factors could account for choroideremia expression in some heterozygous females.  In conclusion, the CHM gene inactivation heterogeneity previ- ously demonstrated at the experimental level is recapitulated in heterozygous female carriers from the two families described here. The combined clinical and experimental data indicates that the inactivation pattern of the CHM gene in peripheral leukocytes probably does not reect the X-inactivation pattern in retinal cells nor predicts the resulting phenotype in choroideremia carriers.

Molecular genetic testing offers a means of con- rming the clinical diagnosis, establishing carrier status and allows presymptomatic diagnosis for families who wish to pursue these options. The aim of this study was to examine the uptake and assess the results from a diagnostic molecular genetics service for CHM.  We have carried out a comprehensive audit of all molecular genetic results of UK NHS patients and families referred to the North West Regional Molecular Genetics Laboratory in Manchester, UK over a 55 month period.  110 people were referred to this service for testing including diagnostic, carrier and predictive re- quests. Putative pathogenic mutations were identied in 65/83 (78%) of male index cases. The identi- cation of a familial pathogenic change enabled carrier testing in 16 asymptomatic females and predictive testing in 3 males. Case examples illustrate the range of cases referred for testing and also reect the need for genetic counselling that results from offering a molecular diagnostic service such as this.  Clinical molecular testing for CHM is available clinically and can be used to support the clinical diagnosis and management of patients with choroideraemia as well as their families. Case studies demonstrate the need to provide genetic testing to families and the potential clinical utility of testing.  2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.  1. Introduction  Choroideraemia (CHM) is an X-linked ocular disorder that leads to the degeneration of the choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium, and the retinal photoreceptors. It has a frequency of between 1/300,000 and 1/400,000 of the general population [1]. Affected males report night blindness in the rst and second de- cades with later progressive eld loss; central vision usually re- mains normal until late in the disease process. Fundus examination is abnormal from early childhood and by early teens shows the characteristic atrophy of the choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and retina. There is loss of rod and cone function on electroretinography. Heterozygous are usually  females  * Corresponding author. Tel.: 44 161 701 4920; fax: 44 161 276 6606.

The causative gene (CHM) on Xq21.1-q21.3 was identied by positional cloning and comprises 15 coding exons that span a genomic sequence of approximately 186 kb [3e5]. The CHM gene product is a protein of 653 amino acids, designated Rab escort protein-1 (REP-1) which plays an essential role in the post- translational lipid modication and subsequent membrane tar- geting of Rab proteins [6e8].  The spectrum of CHM mutations includes deletions, translocations and point mutations (including nonsense, frameshift and splice site) as well as deep intronic mutations [9e11]. Almost all of the patho- genic mutations described give rise to a premature termination codon. Deletions of varying size have also been reported including larger rearrangements comprising virtually the entire Xq21 band [10].  S.C. Ramsden et al. / European Journal of Medical Genetics 56 (2013) 432e438  433  Gene based therapies for inherited retinal dystrophies show great promise. Proof of principle has been demonstrated in animal models for defects in proteins expressed in photoreceptors (RDS/ peripherin) [12], retinal pigment epithelium (RPE65) [13] as well as for extracellular matrix proteins (X-linked juvenile retinoschisis) [14]. There have been promising results from trials of RPE65 gene replacement for patients with Leber congenital amaurosis [15e17] and a phase 1 human gene therapy trial for choroideraemia is un- derway [18]. Such gene-directed therapies rely on an accurate molecular genetic diagnosis and detailed phenotyping.  Genetic testing in inherited retinal dystrophies has become a routine part of ophthalmic evaluation [19,20] offering a means of conrming the clinical diagnosis and enabling more accurate genetic counseling. While such testing opens up the possibility of prenatal and pre-implantation diagnosis, measuring its clinical utility is chal- lenging. In the case of CHM, genetic testing allows the clinician to give better information about prognosis and risks for family members. Carrier status of females can in principle be determined by ophthalmic examination (fundoscopy, autouorescence imaging and full-eld ash electroretinography) however due to the possibility of skewed X-inactivation this cannot exclude carrier status absolutely and molecular genetic analysis can offer an added level of reassurance. Also, risks based upon the assumption of X-linked recessive inheri- tance can be rendered inaccurate as a consequence of new mutations. In addition molecular diagnosis is essential for those families who wish to consider prenatal or pre-implantation diagnosis. We report her on over four year experience of delivering a molecular genetic diagnostic service for UK families affected with CHM.  2. Materials and methods  2.1. Subjects  Patients with a clinical diagnosis of CHM were referred by UK based Consultant Ophthalmologists or Clinical Geneticists for screening of the CHM gene or for carrier detection and presymp- tomatic diagnosis when the family mutation had been identied. All referrals received between June 2008 and December 2011 were included in this service evaluation.  2.2. Genetic analysis  DNA was extracted from whole blood using the Chemagic Magnetic Separation Module I (Chemagen, Germany). Mutation analysis of the CHM gene was performed using bidirectional sequencing of the 15 exons including the intron/exon boundaries as follows. PCR amplication was performed under standard condi- tions with primer annealing at 60 C (primers given in Table 1). Unincorporated dNTPs and primers were removed from 15 ml of PCR product using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter Ge- nomics, USA). Sequencing was performed using BigDye Termi- nator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (ABI, Life Technologies, USA) using the same primers as used for the PCR except for exons 3 and 13 where alternative sequencing primers were used to take account of repetitive sequences in the PCR products. Final clean-up was per- formed using Agencourt CleanSEQ (Beckman Coulter Genomics, USA) and sequence analysis was performed using the 3730xl DNA Analyzer (ABI, Life Technologies, USA).  CHM duplications and deletions were tested using multiplex ligation dependant probe amplication (MLPA) using a commer- cially available kit (SALSA MLPA kit P366 CHM-RP2-RPGR, MRC Holland). The MLPA reactions were carried out according to the manufacturers instructions and analysed on the 3130xl DNA Analyzer (ABI, Life Technologies, USA).

Frameshift, nonsense and splice site (affecting 1, 2, 1 and 2 positions at the intron/exon boundaries) changes were considered pathogenic as were deletions that involved one or more exons as determined by MLPA analysis. In the case of a single exonic deletion (as determined by MLPA) the genomic DNA was sequenced in order to exclude the possibility of a spurious result as a consequence of a rare SNP under the primer binding site. In the absence of further information any outstanding changes were regarded as variants of uncertain clinical signicance.  3. Results  3.1. Referrals  Table 2 shows a summary of the 110 referrals to the CHM mo- lecular genetics service during the evaluation period. Putative pathogenic mutations were identied in 65/83 (78%) of male index cases with a provisional or likely diagnosis of choroideraemia. However for male index cases from families with a clinically conrmed family history of the disease in an affected male relative the mutation pick-up rate was 16/17 (94%) conrming the high sensitivity of the test. The identication of a familial pathogenic change enabled carrier testing in 16 asymptomatic females (for  434  Table 2 Summary of results.  Referral category  S.C.

We have identied 55 unique variants in 69 families with a clear or possible diagnosis of choroideraemia of which 35 have not been previously described. The majority of index cases were affected males.  3.2. Mutation spectrum  Table 3 shows the CHM variants identied. 52 distinct clearly pathogenic mutations were categorised on the basis of the analysis pipeline described above (9 involving a deletion of one or more CHM exons, 12 nonsense, 19 frameshift and 12 splice site muta- tions). A further 3 variants were observed (c.9403delA, p.His507 Arg and p.Leu35Pro) whose clinical signicance could not be determined unequivocally based upon the criteria above and for these further consideration is required. A number of splicing variants have been identied in CHM pa- tients that lie outside the / 1 and 2 canonical splice sites [21]. c.9403delA is predicted to disrupt normal splicing of the CHM RNA using a range of widely available in silico prediction tools (data not shown) and on this basis we would consider it to be highly likely to be disease causing.  To date, only three nucleotide changes that would be predicted to produce missense variants have been found in CHM patients. One was c.1442A > T, a change located at the penultimate nucleo- tide of exon 11 which was subsequently shown to cause complete skipping of this exon during mRNA processing [23]. A second substitution of p.Leu550Pro has been described [24,25] however no in vitro functional analysis was performed. The third missense variant previously identied is p.His507Arg [26], the same as that identied in the current study. In this case it was demonstrated that this variant produces an inactive CHM product. On this evidence we would therefore similarly consider p.His507Arg to be highly likely to be disease causing; p.Leu35Pro, however, has to our knowledge not been identied previously and consequently must currently be regarded as a variant of unknown clinical signicance.  3.3. Clinical utility of testing  As an X-linked condition testing is valuable to support diagnosis, to dene carrier status and to facilitate reproductive decision  making. This is demonstrated in the three cases discussed below. In our cohort the average age at testing was 32 years for males. This was most often implemented to support a new diagnosis, which is important as there can be difculty in making a diagnosis of CHM in early life (see Fig. 1 and exemplied in case example 1). Cascade testing was undertaken for 16 at-risk female patients tested and these aspects of care are illustrated in case examples 2 and 3 describing predictive testing in young males and carrier testing in females.  3.4. Case example 1 e diagnostic and cascade testing (see Fig. 2)  X was referred aged 9, with an unusual appearance at the back of the eye following a routine optician appointment. The family reported no concerns about his vision, although questioning revealed that he was afraid of the dark. On examination, he had characteristic fundal signs of CHM. Blood was taken for molecular testing and a pathogenic CHM variant was identied. The family was seen 6 weeks later to receive the results in the genetic eye clinic.  The diagnosis and inheritance were explained; the family was naturally devastated and anxious about how to tell X and fearful of the potential risks to their other two sons. The family was con- cerned about the risks to the wider family. X had no family history of CHM although his mother was found to have the characteristic retinal changes. By contrast Xs maternal grandmother had a normal retinal appearance and was found not to carry the patho- genic CHM variant. This suggested a new mutation in Xs mother or gonadal mosaicism in her grandmother or grandfather. Xs aunt also requested testing at her local genetic centre and was found not to be a carrier. This reassured the wider family but left Xs mother with a greater sense of guilt as she alone had the mutation causing her sons diagnosis.  3.5. Case example 2 e carrier testing (see Fig. 2)  Patient S requested referral to the genetic clinic, following a recent diagnosis of CHM in her brother when he was 26 years of age. She attended with her husband and described how the family was struggling to come to terms with Ss brothers diagnosis. He had studied successfully at university, and was working towards becoming chartered in his career. They felt that his deteriorating vision and prognosis would prevent him from achieving his career goals. The family was in a state of shock and grief following the diagnosis. There was no known previous family history.  While these emotions on the part of the family are under- standable, the consultation gave a more realistic appreciation of the progression of the disorder e that is, reading vision until 50 years of age in most affected males, as well as the outlook for preventative treatment such as gene therapy which is being assessed presently. S wanted to know if she was a carrier and felt that she would not want to pass the gene down to her children. The discussion aimed to help S with the dilemmas she would face if found to be a carrier in which case she felt she would plan not to have children. The option of pre-implantation diagnosis was raised, using IVF and genetic testing of embryos. Molecular testing was organized for her brother and the pathogenic mutation was identied. A follow-up appointment was arranged and S remained determined that she wanted carrier testing in order to make reproductive decisions. At testing S was examined and had a normal fundus appearance. While the normal exam reduced the likelihood of carrier status, a denitive genetic test was nonetheless undertaken. Fortunately S did not carry the pathogenic mutation; however she expressed mixed feelings about the result. In some ways she wished that she had the gene instead of her brother as it would have no effect on her  S.C.

Case example 3 e presymptomatic testing (see Fig. 2)  R had been known to the genetic department for a number of years having grown up knowing she was a carrier of CHM. Her mother was an obligate carrier based on family history (not shown  A  Patient X  C  B  Patient R  Patient S  Fig. 2. Case examples described in the text.  in Fig. 2) and R had been examined as a child and found to have the characteristic retinal changes. R attended the genetic clinic after the birth of her rst child, a male. She was aware of the inheritance of the condition and knew that her son was at 50% risk. She wondered whether he should have a blood test. Molecular testing had not previously been available, so blood was collected from R and the mutation identied.  Counseling sessions explored the reasons for testing and the option of delaying. Rs husband felt that the baby should not be tested as the burden of knowledge would impact on the whole family and how he was treated. R, on the other hand, felt she was living with the worry of vision impairment and just needed to know. She described her feelings of guilt. She also reasoned that she needed to know for future reproductive plans. She did not know if she could cope with passing the gene on twice although she was keen for more children.  The couple were encouraged to take time with the decision as there were no clinical reasons for early testing. As a slowly pro- gressive condition any changes would be obvious much later. Males affected by choroideraemia do not usually need educational sup- port and may have night blindness in their teens. It was explained that a male carrier of choroideraemia is highly likely to have a normal early life. When the son reached 18 months, R felt that she could no longer cope with not knowing. Her husband had now read about the potentials for gene therapy trials and was beginning to feel there may be advantages to knowing, although it was clearly explained that the son was too young to be part of any trial for many years to come. As the couple was now in agreement, a blood sample was collected and the pathogenic variant was identied in the son. After several months, the couple felt able to come back to the genetic clinic to talk about the impact of these gene test results.  S.C. Ramsden et al. / European Journal of Medical Genetics 56 (2013) 432e438  437  Following the initial shock of the bad news, they were both trying to look on the positive side although the test continues to have an impact on their decisions for further children.  4. Discussion  We have demonstrated a clear demand from both Ophthal- mologists and Clinical Geneticists for a diagnostic molecular ge- netics service for CHM. We have identied 55 unique variants in 69 families with a clear or possible diagnosis of choroideraemia. 54/55 variants can be categorized as highly likely to be pathogenic based upon current understanding of the gene (see Results) and 35 have not been previously described, signicantly increasing the known mutational spectrum of this disease. In one instance (c.9403delA) the variant was reported to the referring clinician as likely to be pathogenic based upon in silico analysis of splicing efciency.  The majority of index cases were affected males, however this also includes affected females as well as obligate female carriers. The 78% sensitivity gure in affected males is misleading. When clinicians refer patients on a service basis, the accompanying clin- ical details are sparse and it is not possible to generate meaningful gures for test sensitivity from this cohort of patients. While it is most likely that pick-up rates would be improved by applying strict acceptance criteria, this would not suit the aims of the referring clinicians. When considering only those male index cases from families with a clinically conrmed family history of the disease then we observe a mutation pick-up rate of 94% conrming a high sensitivity in cases with a strong clinical indication.  The determination of pathogenicity of novel variants poses a signicant problem in molecular diagnosis. In line with previous studies, the majority of mutations found in this study are predicted to result in functionally null alleles and in line with current clinical practice one can predict with a high degree of certainly these are highly likely to be pathogenic.  It is essential that pathogenicity can be determined wherever possible. Of all the changes identied only one, p.Leu35Pro, was reported to the referring clinician as a variant of uncertain clinical signicance. In cases such as this it is routine practice within a diagnostic laboratory to use in silico predictions of pathogenicity by dening the evolutionary conservation of the amino acid with multiple sequence alignments and the tolerance of the amino acid change based upon the Grantham matrix [27]. However it is not acceptable to base an unequivocal clinical interpretation solely on these lines of evidence. Functional studies to examine the effects on REP-1 protein function were not available and consequently the appropriateness of family studies to investigate whether this variant co-segregates with the disease phenotype will be consid- ered as part of the follow-up care.  We have described the rst 55 months of this clinical molecular service and during this period the average age at molecular diag- nosis was 32 years for males which is relatively high. As this service matures it may be anticipated that ascertainment may focus more heavily on new diagnoses. Consequently we predict that the age at molecular diagnosis is likely to fall as molecular testing becomes increasing used as a tool for the early diagnosis of the disease. Further research will be needed to explore how families come to terms with early diagnosis. The availability of genetic testing may also lead to increasing requests for predictive testing in young males. The Genetic testing of Children Guidelines from the British Society of Human Genetics [28] encourage delay and caution in testing children where there is no prevention or medical inter- vention and the test is primarily predictive of future illness. Moore and Burton [29] call for the need for counseling protocols for pre- dictive testing and further research is needed to understand the risks and utility of testing in these circumstances.  Of the 3 female index cases referred with clinical signs sugges- tive of carrier status (but no family history) none had a pathogenic change in CHM. It is possible that a more detailed phenotyping of these patients may have similarly excluded carrier status however it remains likely that these females have another molecular cause for an underlying inherited retinal dystrophy.  For those families with a pathogenic CHM mutation carrier testing in females is clearly now a possibility and, during the course of this service, there have been requests for carrier testing in 16 at- risk females with a conrmed molecular diagnosis in the family. While the majority of carriers are identiable on the basis of fundus appearance the absence of abnormalities does not comprehen- sively exclude the possibility of carrier status. Furthermore, refer- ring clinicians (both geneticists and ophthalmologists) may not be condent in diagnosing carrier state on fundoscopy e in this context molecular genetic testing may be considered as an alter- native to referral to a specialist centre.  It is likely that the demand for cascade testing will increase as a molecular diagnosis is established in a greater number of families. Decisions around carrier testing depend on the nature and perceived burden of the condition as well as individual family circumstances and attitudes towards testing [30e32], The psy- chosocial impact of carrier testing includes guilt and anxiety around risks to children as well as the impact on the wider family [32,33]. Some women prefer to delay testing in order to continue with reproductive decisions without the burden of this knowl- edge. Other women prefer to be prepared and use genetic knowledge to make informed choices. Evidence also suggests that couples may make decisions around reproduction and even pre- natal testing following genetic testing for retinal dystrophy [34]. Carrier testing for X-linked conditions is normally offered from the age of 16 when a woman is old enough to make an autonomous decision.  The results of this study demonstrate the successful imple- mentation of a genetic testing service for CHM; the service has allowed molecular conrmation of diagnosis leading to improved genetic counseling .Molecular testing has also facilitated the ascertainment of affected males with a specic molecular diagnosis who are suitable for clinical trials of novel therapies such as gene replacement therapy.

In this study, Australian families clinically   diagnosed with choroideremia were genetically analysed for mutations in the CHM   gene.   Design: The Australian Inherited Retinal Disease Register and DNA Bank (AIRDR)   was investigated to identify a cohort of choroideremia affected families for genetic   analysis.   Participants: Participants were sourced from the AIRDR. Thirty-two participants   (15 affected, 10 carriers, 7 unaffected) sourced from eleven unrelated families   having at least one member clinically diagnosed with choroideremia were included in   the study.   Methods: We performed sequence analysis of the CHM gene on the DNA of nine   probands. We received the direct sequencing results of two probands by other   means. Targeted analysis was subsequently performed for all 32 participants to   confirm the direct sequencing results in the 11 probands and to establish the   presence or absence of the implicated mutation in the remaining 21 affected, carrier   or unaffected family members.   Main Outcome Measures: Genetic characterisation of 11 choroideremia families in   the Australian population.   Results: A CHM mutation was detected in all 11 families. Each family had a   different mutation. Mutations segregated within each family according to disease   status. Five mutations were novel and six have been previously reported.    Conclusions: Six previously reported and five novel CHM mutations were detected   in 11 Australian families clinically diagnosed with choroideremia. We anticipate that   this work will facilitate access for AIRDR participants and their progeny to CHM gene   therapy trials.      KEYWORDS: choroideremia, CHM, Rab escort protein 1, REP1   This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.   Accepted ArticleINTRODUCTION      Choroideremia (CHM, OMIM:303100) is a rare X-linked recessive chorioretinal   dystrophy characterised by slow progressive degeneration of the choroid, retinal   pigment epithelium and retinal photoreceptors. Its incidence has been estimated   between 1 in 50,000 and 1 in 100,000 people.1 Affected males initially show   symptoms of night blindness within the first or second decades followed by   progressive peripheral visual field loss, with central vision preserved until late in life.2   Complete blindness has been reported at middle age in some patients.2-4   Carrier females are usually asymptomatic. However, some develop night blindness   and visual field loss. Most but not all have a characteristic fundus appearance,   especially with increasing age.5   Choroideremia is known to be caused by mutations in the CHM gene   (OMIM:300390), which is comprised of 15 exons spanning at least 150kb and   located at Xq 21.2  q21.3.6 The CHM gene encodes Rab escort protein 1 (REP1), a   protein composed of 653 amino acids, which is a component of Rab   geranylgeranyltransferase, an enzyme complex that mediates correct intracellular   vesicular transport.7 There have been at least 195 CHM gene mutations reported in   the Human Genome Mutation database (HGMD).8   Various methods have been reported for the detection of variants in the CHM gene.   Direct sequencing analysis, with a choroideremia-causing variant detection rate of   approximately 60%  95%, is recommended as the first investigative option.5   A multi-centre human gene replacement clinical trial is currently underway for   choroideremia.9 This phase 1/2 trial uses an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV2) to   deliver the REP1 gene directly to the retina. Improved visual outcomes were   reported for the six individuals involved in the trial.10 With the increased likelihood   that individuals affected with choroideremia may benefit from gene therapy trials or   gene-specific treatments in the near future, the genetic confirmation of this disease   and identification of the specific variant in clinically diagnosed individuals has   become a high priority for the Australian Inherited Retinal Disease Register and DNA   Bank (AIRDR).

Accepted ArticleThe aim of this study was to genetically analyse the cohort of Australian families in   the AIRDR with a familial diagnosis of choroideremia to determine the disease-  causing variants. We report the genetic confirmation of choroideremia in 11 families,   and the identification of six known and five novel variants in the CHM gene in our   Australian cohort.      METHODS      This research study was approved by the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital Human   Research Ethics Committee (Human Ethics approval Number 2001-053) and was   conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed   consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the above.   All participants were sourced from the AIRDR.11 Thirty-two participants from eleven   unrelated families, each with at least one affected male family member clinically   diagnosed with choroideremia, were identified and included in the study. The clinical   diagnosis of choroideremia was provided by each of the affected participants   ophthalmologists. Following informed consent, demographic, family pedigree and   clinical information to support the diagnosis (including visual acuity, age of onset,   extent of night blindness, and peripheral fields) was gathered by telephone, personal   interview, or completion of a mailed questionnaire. Relevant medical records were   accessed when available.   Collection, processing and storage of DNA samples was carried out as detailed   previously.11   All 15 exons and flanking intronic regions of the CHM gene from the DNA of one   participant from each of nine families was analysed by bi-directional Sanger   sequencing. Sequencing was performed by either Carver Laboratories, Iowa, USA (8   probands), or Casey Eye Institute Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Oregon, USA   (CEI) (1 proband).   For eight of these nine families, the DNA from an affected male proband was   analysed.   This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.   Accepted ArticleFor the ninth family (Family 9) the obligate carrier mother of a clinically diagnosed   affected male who did not wish to participate in the study was chosen as the   proband.   For the two remaining families, genetic analysis results were provided from other   laboratories. For these two families, we target sequenced the provided variants for   all family members for whom we had DNA, as described below.   For all 32 participants, targeted sequencing analysis of the exon or intronic region   indicated by the established or provided sequence variants was subsequently   performed (Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF), Perth, Western Australia or   CEI), for (a) confirmation of the proband results and (b) establishment of the   absence or presence of the identified sequence variants in family members, for   subsequent cosegregation analysis.   Interpretation of results was carried out using the reference sequence   NM_000390.2.   Variant pathogenicity was determined using standard web-based software prediction   tools and in silico pathogenicity programs such as MutationTaster12 for both the   known and novel variants. Classification of pathogenicity was assigned with   reference to recent variant assessment literature.13      RESULTS      Phenotypes   All 11 family pedigrees were consistent with X-linked transmission. Phenotypic   information for the consenting choroideremia affected males in this study is detailed   in Table 1 (Note: Family 9 does not include a consenting affected male).The age   range of affected male participants was 14  69 years. Of the 15 affected males, 11   reported onset of night blindness and severely restricted peripheral visual fields   within the first decade, as is classically expected. The affected males from Families 4   and 5 reported their ages at onset and diagnosis to be in their mid-twenties or later.   The affected male from Family 11 reported his age at onset as 16 years.      Genotyping   This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.   Accepted ArticleA disease-causing sequence variant in the CHM gene was identified for all 11 families   analysed. The identified sequence variant was different for each of the 11 families   and, in every family, it segregated with the disease for all members whose clinical   phenotype was known. Of the 11 mutations identified, there were four nonsense;   four frameshift; and three splice site mutations. Five of the mutations were novel   and six have been previously reported.   All disease-causing sequence variants detected are detailed in Table 2. The clinical   status and the zygosity of the variant for each participant are detailed in Table 3. A   description of each familys identified mutation follows.      Previously reported mutations   Six previously reported mutations were detected in Families 1 to 6. MutationTaster   predicts each of these variants of the CHM gene to be disease-causing. All six   sequence variants are documented in the HGMD and Leiden Open Variant (LOVD)14   databases. With the exception of the variant c.1179_1180delGT detected in Family   6, all of the identified variants have been widely reported in the literature as   causative for choroideremia in the affected families studied.      Family 1   A sequence variant c.1584_1587delTGTT (p.Val529Hisfs*7) in exon 13 was detected   in the affected male proband in this family. This variant is predicted to introduce an   early stop codon seven amino acids downstream from the two base pair deletion.   This variant has been previously reported as disease-causing for choroideremia.15-18   Experimental evidence using a protein truncation test and immunoblot analysis has   demonstrated that this variant causes truncation of the encoded protein, REP1.17   The probands mother and affected brother also possessed this variant. The   probands unaffected brother did not possess this variant.      Family 2   A splice site variant c.116+1G>A in intron 2 was found in the proband and the   probands mother. This variant has previously been reported as causative for   choroideremia.16, 18-20 The variant is expected to cause aberrant splicing of the mRNA   This article is protected by copyright.

Two maternal uncles of the probands mother   were reportedly also affected with choroideremia but were unavailable for analysis.   The segregation of the variant with the disease status of the genetically analysed   members of this family, the prediction of a non-functional REP1 protein, and the   association of the variant with choroideremia reported in other families implicate this   as the disease-causing variant for this family.      Family 3   The affected male proband in this family had a nonsense sequence variant c.757C>T   (p.Arg253*) in exon 6. This variant has previously been reported.2, 21 Confirmation   that the mutation results in synthesis of a truncated protein was demonstrated by in   vitro transcription/translation assay.2  The probands affected nephew and the   probands sister (the affected nephews mother) also possesed this variant.      Family 4   A nonsense sequence variant c.808C>T (p.Arg270*) in exon 6 was found in the   affected male proband in this family. This variant, previously reported as pathogenic,   introduces an early stop codon, which prematurely terminates synthesis of REP1.19-21   The probands sister and affected brother also possessed this variant. The sister had   a reportedly affected son who was not a participant in this study.      Family 5   A nonsense sequence variant c.877C>T (p.Arg293*) in exon 7 was identified for the   male proband of this family. This variant has previously been reported.2, 4, 18, 21-23 As   for the variant detected in Family 4, in vitro transcription/translation assay confirmed   that this variant results in the synthesis of a truncated protein.2 Further family   members have been clinically diagnosed with choroideremia but no family members   were available for genetic analysis. This variant is implicated as highly likely to cause   choroideremia in this participant.      Family 6   This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.   Accepted ArticleA frameshift variant c.1179_1180delGT (p.Phe394Trpfs*23) was detected in exon 9   of the CHM gene in this family. This variant introduces an early stop codon 23 amino   acids downstream of the deletion and is predicted to cause truncation of REP1. This   variant was detected in the proband and his affected brother. Their mother, in   whom clinical signs of a retinopathy had been observed in the fundus prior to   diagnosis of her sons within their first decade, tested as heterozygous for the   variant. There has been a single previous report of this variant.18      Novel mutations   The following five mutations were identified in Families 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Searches   of HGMD, LOVD, dbSNP, 1000 Genome databases and the literature found no report   of these variants. To the best of our knowledge they have not been previously   reported and so appear to be novel.      Family 7   The male proband in this family had a frameshift sequence variant c.685dupA   (Ile229Asnfs*2) in exon 5. MutationTaster predicts the c.685dupA nucleotide change   triggers nonsense mediated decay (NMD), which would prevent protein expression.   Even if NMD does not occur, the REP1 mutant protein is highly likely to be non-  functional, because the frameshift starts at codon 229. This causes premature   termination, removing 425 amino acids, including residues involved in protein-  protein interaction and structural domains, as well as 70 C-terminus amino acids that   are reported to be critical to REP1 activity.7, 24 The probands mother tested as   heterozygous for the variant. Three other clinically unaffected female family   members did not possess this variant. The maternal grandmother also did not   possess this variant, but her clinical examination was inconclusive. This variant is   highly likely to be pathogenic for choroideremia.       Family 8   The presence of the splice site variant c.819+1G>C in intron 6, previously confirmed   by Gene Dx, was reconfirmed in the male proband in this family. This variant   destroys the canonical splice donor site in intron 6. It is predicted to cause abnormal   This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.   Accepted Articlegene splicing, either leading to an abnormal message that is subject to NMD, or to   an abnormal protein product if the message is used for protein translation.25   Although this variant has not been published in the literature to our knowledge, its   presence and predicted effect is consistent with the diagnosis of choroideremia in   this individual. Our targeted analysis detected that the affected maternal grandfather   of the proband also possessed this variant and that the probands mother was   heterozygous for the variant. The probands unaffected brother did not possess this   variant. This variant is therefore strongly implicated as pathogenic for   choroideremia.      Family 9   A heterozygous nonsense sequence variant c.1273C>T (p.Gln425*) was found in   exon 10 in the mother (proband) of a male who was clinically diagnosed with   choroideremia but who was unwilling to participate in this study. The affected males   sister showed clinical carrier signs and also tested as heterozygous for this variant.   In the absence of affected male family member DNA, we cannot conclusively state   that c.1273C>T is the sole choroideremia-causing variant in this family. This   nucleotide change is predicted to lead to an early stop codon, which prematurely   terminates synthesis of the protein REP1. MutationTaster predicts that the   c.1273C>T change triggers nonsense mediated decay (NMD), which prevents   protein expression. Even if NMD does not occur, the REP1 mutant protein is highly   likely to be non-functional, because it would truncate at codon 425, removing 229   amino acids, including residues involved in protein-protein interaction and structural   domains, as well as 70 C-terminus amino acids that are reported to be critical to   REP1 activity.7, 24 Consequently, we classify this finding as likely pathogenic.      Family 10   A novel nucleotide deletion c.1287_1288delTG (p.Glu430Alafs*11) in exon 10 was   detected in the affected male proband. The probands mother tested as   heterozygous for this sequence variant. It is highly likely that this deletion is   pathogenic because it is predicted to cause a frameshift that prematurely truncates   the REP1 protein at codon 439, removing 214 of the amino acids normally present in   This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.   Accepted Articlethe wild type protein. In silico analysis programs, Mutation Taster and SIFT Indel,   predict that NMD is likely to occur.  A deletion occurring one base pair away from   c.1287_1288delTG has been reported.26 The authors analysed this variant by in vitro   transcription/translation, and determined that the c.1286_1287delCT variant caused   abnormal protein expression in vitro, and concluded it was causative of the patients   choroideremia. Mutations causing frameshifts located upstream of the   c.1287_1288delTG variant (such as c.1542T>A p.Tyr504*) have been demonstrated   by immunoblot assay to cause absence of REP1 protein.16 This indicates that a   truncation at amino acid position 440 is also likely to be damaging. Consequently,   we classify this finding as likely pathogenic.      Family 11   The presence of the splice site variant c.940+1G>A was detected in intron 7 in the   male proband of this family. This variant had previously been detected in an affected   family  member  by  Manchester  Centre  for  Genomic  Medicine.  No  other  family   members were available for testing. In silico analysis predicts that the G>A change   abolishes  a  conserved  donor  splice  site,  leading  to  abnormal  splicing  of  REP1.   Functional  analysis  has  been  performed  on  a  G>T  change  reportedly  occurring  at   the same nucleotide position, and the investigators found that this particular variant   causes in vitro truncation in the transcript.2 This suggests that the 940+1 nucleotide   is an invariant donor splice site, which is critical for normal splicing.  Another report   of  the  940+1G>T  noted  that  this  splice  site  position  displays  100%  consensus.16   Therefore,  this  position  is  unlikely  to  tolerate  change.  Based  on  this  evidence,  it  is   highly likely the c.940+1G>A change is also pathogenic.      DISCUSSION      In this study, we have characterised the spectrum of mutations of the CHM gene in   11 unrelated Australian families, each of which had at least one male member   clinically diagnosed with choroideremia. Thirty-two participants from 11 Australian   families sourced from the AIRDR were studied. All participating affected family   This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Five of the 11   mutations are novel. The spectrum of mutations detected in the Australian cohort -   four nonsense, four frameshift and three splice mutations - is similar to reports from   other populations.2, 18-21, 27   For consenting participants, genetic analysis results are being reported in a research   context to the participants nominated ophthalmologist or genetics counselling   service to facilitate clinical management and potential involvement in gene-specific   therapies.   We note that four of the 10 male probands in our study had originally been   diagnosed at an early age (< 10 years) with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa. We also   note that clinically diagnosed choroideremia participants are under-represented in   the AIRDR by a factor of two to three with respect to, for example, retinitis   pigmentosa. This, coupled with the fact that all 10 male probands clinically   diagnosed with choroideremia subsequently had this diagnosis genetically confirmed,   suggests that choroideremia may be under-diagnosed in Australia. We suggest this   be taken into consideration when a genetic analysis strategy is being designed for a   member of a pedigree having an inheritance pattern consistent with X-linked   transmission and for which the phenotype of affected members is consistent with   choroideremia.   We also note that, during this study, the confirmational targeted sequencing analysis   identified variant reporting errors by the initial sequencing provider for two   probands. This highlights the necessity for confirmational analysis.   In conclusion, we have established the molecular confirmation of choroideremia for   14 individuals clinically diagnosed with choroideremia. Some of these individuals may   be suitable for inclusion in CHM gene therapy clinical trials. Four families have two   genetically confirmed individuals. Other undiagnosed, untested or unborn male   family members may also prove to be candidate gene therapy recipients in the   future.    In addition to molecular confirmation being a prerequisite for inclusion in gene-  specific trials and treatments, acceptance of an individual onto a trial may be   dependent on the amenability for treatment of the specific mutation we have   This article is protected by copyright.

We have performed mutation screening in patients from 15 Danish and Swedish families by using Southern blot hybridization  and  the  polymerase  chain  reaction  single-strand  conformation  polymorphism  (PCR-SSCP) technique. Causative mutations in the CHM gene were detected In at least 12 families, Indicating that a substantial part  of the  mutations can  be  identified  by this approach.  In four  of these  families deletions  of  different  sizes were found. Thus, In one  patient, the deletion  resulted  in the absence  of only one exon, while  In another  the deletion comprised the entire CHM gene. Mapping of the deletion endpolnts in these four patients and in another 11 male patients with sizeable deletions enabled us to construct a very detailed map of intervals 2 and 3 of Xq21. In the remaining 11 Danish and Swedish families at least 8 causative mutations were found by PCR -  SSCP analysis and direct sequencing.  Interestingly,  all CHM gene  mutations detected thus far  in choroideremia  patients give rise to  the  Introduction  of  a premature  stop codon.  INTRODUCTION Choroideremia  is an X-linked  chorioretinal  dystrophy  in which affected  males suffer  from progressive night blindness and visual field  constriction, which develops into complete blindness by the fourth  to fifth decade of life (1,2). Female carriers are normally asymptomatic,  but  can  be  diagnosed  because  of  characteristic pigment  abnormalities  of the ocular  fundus.  Positional  cloning strategies (3,4) and cDNA library screening (5) have been applied successfully  to isolate  the  human  choroideremia  (CHM)  gene. This  gene  was  found  to  be  expressed  in  various  tissue  types, including  retina,  choroid  and/or  retinal  pigment epithelium (3; F.P.M.C. unpublished data). Recently  it was demonstrated that the CHM gene escapes X chromosome  inactivation  (6). This is remarkable,  since  the  patchy  changes  of  the  retinal  pigment epithelium  in  carrier  females  had  been  generally  taken  for evidence  that  the  CHM  gene  is  subject  to  X-inactivation.  The open reading frame (ORF) of the CHM gene was found to consist of  15 exons,  which  are  partly  or  completely  lacking  in  male choroideremia patients with deletions and in two female patients  To  whom  correspondence  should  be  addressed  carrying  a  balanced  X-autosome  translocation  involving  the Xq21.2  band  (3,5,7-9).  In  lymphoblasts  of  such  patients  the activity  of  Rab  geranylgeranyl  transferase  (Rab  GGTase)  is markedly  reduced  as  compared  to  lymphoblasts  of  control individuals,  which  is in keeping  with  the proposed  function  of the  CHM  protein  (10,11).  Convincing evidence that choroideremia  is caused by  defects in  the  CHM  gene  has  been  provided  by  the  identification,  in patients  with  classic  choroideremia,  of  several  point  mutations in the 3' portion of the ORF of this gene (12-15).  Yet, in most choroideremia patients analyzed thus far  mutations in the CHM gene  could  not  be  detected  because  neither  the  entire  cDNA sequence nor the intron-exon  structure of the CHM gene were known.  Only  very  recently,  we  have  elucidated  the  genomic structure  of  the  CHM  gene,  which  consists  of  15 exons  (5). Sequencing of exon-intron boundaries has enabled us to design matching oligonucleotide primers which are suitable for single- strand  conformation  polymorphism  (SSCP)  analysis.  1048  Human  Molecular  Genetics,  1994,  Vol.  3,  No.  7  Table  1.

Previously,  Schwartz  et  al.  (14)  had  screened  12  Danish choroideremia families for the occurrence of mutations in exons 11 to 14 of the CHM gene. In 4 of these families, small mutations were detected that disrupt the ORF of the CHM gene. In addition, deletions  were  detected  in  2  out  of  these  12  families  which removed one or several of the analyzed exons. In the remaining 6  Danish  families  and  in  3  Swedish  families,  we  have  now extended  the  mutation  search  and  the  deletion  analysis  to  the previously  unknown  5'  segment  of  the  CHM  gene.  RESULTS Detection of mutations in Danish and Swedish choroideremia patients The intronic nucleotide sequences directly adjacent  to the CHM exons were determined  and used to design primer  sets that can be  used  for  PCR-SSCP  analysis  (Table  1).  Because  of  the relative large size of exon 5, two sets of primers were used  for PCR  amplification  of  this  exon,  each  consisting  of  an  intron- specific  and  an  exon-specific  primer.  By  using  the  primers depicted  in  Table  1,  PCR-SSCP  analysis  was  performed  to screen for  nucleotide sequence variation  in exons 5 to 8 and  10 to  15.  PCR-amplified  fragments  with altered electrophoretic mobility were further  analyzed by direct DNA  sequencing.  In this way,  mutations were detected  in 5 families  (Table 2). In patients BO and  JS,  insertions  of  one  nucleotide  in  exon  5  and  exon  8, respectively,  result  in  frameshift  mutations.  A deletion  of  two nucleotides in exon 5 of patient FK also disrupts the open reading frame  and  introduces  a  premature  stop  codon.  In  patient  LN, a  point  mutation  (C  to  T)  at  nucleotide  position  changes  an arginine codon to a stop codon  in exon 7. For one other patient (PU) the aberrant  mobility  of  PCR  fragments  was caused  by a single  base  substitution  in  intron  4.  The  T  to  G  change  at nucleotide  14 of  the  splice  acceptor  site  was  not detected  in 10 independent controls, but the pathogenetic role, if any, of this mutation  remains  to  be  established.  For  individuals  from  the  Swedish  choroideremia  families LUN1  and  LUN3  no products  were  obtained  upon  PCR  with primers  for  several  CHM  exons,  indicating  that  these  patients carry a deletion that spans at least part of the CHM gene (Table 2).  The  occurrence  of  large  deletions  in  these  patients  was confirmed  by  Southern  blotting  and  hybridization  with  CHM cDNA  probes.  The deletion  endpoints  in  these  patients  and  in two  previously  reported  Danish  patients  (UH  and  MS)  were mapped  in detail,  as  described  below.

These endpoints, together with the translocation  breakpoints of two CHM females characterized previously (3,5,16), subdivide the Xq21 interval carrying the CHM gene into 21 distinct physical segments.  The  size of  the deletions  was found  to vary  widely, ranging  from  deletion  of a single exon  (patient  UH,  who lacks exon  12), to deletions of 5 to  15 megabases, that span the entire CHM  gene  (e.g.  patients  LGL2905,  25.6,  and  MBU).  Patient LUN1  also  has a large deletion,  encompassing  DXS540 at the proximal  side of CHM  as well as DXS3 and  DXS990 distally. Furthermore, two of the deletions (patients MS and 33.1) allowed the  establishment  of  the  following  order  of  markers  Xcen- (DXS540,  CHM>DXS1002-(DXS95,  DXS349)-DXS110-Xqter. Also  indicated  in  Fig.  1 are  the  positions  of  two  new  highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, that should be useful  for the diagnosis  of  choroideremia  in  families  (17;  manuscript  in preparation).  DISCUSSION The elucidation of the intron sequences directly flanking the CHM exons should facilitate exhaustive screening for mutations in the CHM  ORF  of  choroideremia  patients.  The  feasibility  of  this approach  was  illustrated  by  the  proportional  high  number  of mutations  detected  in the  CHM  gene  in patients of  the  Danish population.  Despite  the  fact  that  we analyzed  only  9 of the  15 exons,  causative  mutations  were  identified  in  at  least  10 and possibly  11 out of  12 families. In 7 of these, mutations were found in  the  CHM  ORF,  and  in  one  family  (patient  FC)  a  mutation was  identified  that  alters  a  stricdy  conserved  nucleotide  of the splice site acceptor  sequence (AGGG;  18,19). This mutation will  probably  result  in  the  skipping  of  exon  12 in  the  splicing reaction and thereby create a framesnift  in the downstream ORF. Another  splice acceptor  mutation  was  identified  in  patient  PU, who shows a very mild choroideremia disease course. The TG change  at  position  - 14  of  exon  5  does  not  lead to a  dramatic deviation from  the splice site consensus sequence (84% to 79%, according to 20). Therefore,  an RT-PCR  analysis of the CHM mRNA in this patient will be required to investigate whether this subtle  the  mild manifestation  of choroideremia in this patient. No mutations have been detected as yet in the CHM gene of three, and possibly only two, of the  15 patients analyzed.  Of course,  it is quite possible that the not yet detected  mutations reside in the exons that were not analyzed  in this study.  In addition,  it can be envisaged  that mutations  that  affect  the  promoter  of  the  gene  are  involved  in some  cases  of  choroideremia.  The  occurrence  of  mutations  in the promoter  region  is suggested by reduced or absent levels of CHM  mRNAs  in 25 of 34 male patients  studied previously  (4; F.P.M.C.,  unpublished  data).  However,  isolation  and characterization of 5' flanking sequences will be required to prove that  mutations  in  the  CHM  promoter  do  indeed  play  a  role in choroideremia.  is  indeed  causative  for   intron  mutation   Thus far,  14 different  small  mutations have been detected  in the CHM gene (12 -15). The TTGT deletion in exon  13 has been found  in  three  apparently  unrelated  families  from  Germany, France  and  Denmark  (12,14,15).  The  high  mutability  of  this sequence may be due to polymerase slippage during  replication since  in  the  normal  CHM  sequence,  the  TTGT  sequence  is duplicated.  Interestingly,  all  mutations  known  to  date  lead  to premature stops during translation. Consequently, CHM proteins synthesized  by  these  genes  will  be  truncated  at  the  carboxy-  terminus,  if protein  is synthesized  at all.  Recendy,  it has been shown that a recombinant CHM protein that lacks the 70 carboxy- terminal  amino acids  is unable  to function  as a subunit  of  Rab GGTase  (F.P.M.C.,  unpublished  data).  Since  all  the  CHM mutations known to date give rise to carboxy-terminal truncations of more than 70 amino acids,  it is clear that the resulting  CHM proteins will be non-functional.  Moreover, this finding  explains why  there  is  no  apparent  correlation  between  the  clinical manifestation of the disease and the underlying genotypes, except maybe for patient PU. Missense mutations have not been  found up to now and it dius seems that only mutations that completely inactivate  the  (synthesis  of  a)  gene  product  will  cause choroideremia.  Missense mutations in the CHM gene may have no  clinical  effect.  If  so,  there  would  be  a  low  pressure  on sequence conservation,  which is contradicted by the high degree of homology  between the human,  rat and  mouse CHM  protein sequences.  Alternatively,  missense  mutations  may  give  rise  to a  different  disease  phenotype  or  are  not  allowed  because  of interference  with  the  function  of  the  CHML  protein.  The fine localization of breakpoints in 15 patients with deletions in Xq21.2  and  in  2  females  with  an  X-autosome  translocation has  facilitated  die  construction  of  a  detailed  physical  map  of intervals  2  and  3  of  Xq21. In  all  choroideremia  patients  with deletions or  translocations  the X-chromosomal  breakpoints  are located within the CHM gene, indicating that it is highly unlikely that  otfier  loci  for  choroideremia  exist  on  the  X  chromosome. An enormous variation in size and position of the deletions was observed,  indicating that there are no obvious hot-spots  for  the induction of chromosomal breakpoints near or within the CHM gene.  The  CHM  gene  spans  at  least  150 kb of  genomic  DNA as based on restriction  analysis (unpublished  data). Yet,  only 2 of  15 deletions are located entirely within the CHM gene, while the  others  have  at  least  one  endpoint  outside  the  gene. Interestingly,  even the largest  deletions are  not associated  with obvious  clinical  features  other  than  choroideremia,  thereby providing  further  evidence  for  the  scarcity  of  genes  in Xq21. Moreover,  the  assignment  of  genes  for  nonspecific  mental retardation (XLMR), sensorineural deafness  (DFN3) to interval 2 of Xq21 (21-26)  is corroborated  by the finding  that none of the  deletions  in  patients  with  classic  choroideremia  extends proximally  beyond  DXS121.  MATERIALS  AND  METHODS CHM  patients  and  cell  lines The  diagnostic  criteria  of  choroideremia  included  a  history  of  night  blindness and  the  appearance  of  the  fundus,  showing  peripheral  pigmentary  retinopathy with  areas  of  pigmentepithelial  and  cboroidal  atrophy.  The  diagnoses  were supported by a pattern of X-linked inheritance and retinal carrier signs in mothers or daughters. Clinical investigation of the 11 Danish patients not reported previously was carried out by T.R.,  S.A.  (LUN1 and LUN3), M.J. (C759) and K.R. (2082). The clinical and molecular data on the other patients have been described elsewhere: UH,  CN,  TN,  FC and  JW  (14);  LGL2905,  LGL1134,  LGL1101, 3.5,  25.6, 7.6,  C3  and  33.1  (7);  MBU  (22);  t(X;13)  (16)  and  t(X;7)  (5).  Southern  blot  analysis Chromosomal  DNA  was  isolated,  essentially  according  to a  method  described elsewhere  (27).  DNA  (10  /ig)  was  digested  with  EcoRl  and  fragments  were resolved  by electrophoresis  in  a  1 % agarose  gel  and  blotted  onto  GeneScreen Plus membranes (New England  Nuclear).  32P-labeled  probes were prepared by random hexamer priming (28,29) on the appropriate  DNA  fragments  that  were isolated  in  low-gelling  temperature  agarose  (Biolabs).  Prehybridization  and hybridization  were performed  as described  previously  (21), at a temperature of 65C. Washing was done at the same temperature  in 40 mM sodium  phosphate (pH  7.2)  and  1%  (w/v)  sodium  dodecyl  sulphate  (SDS).  Determination  of  deletion  endpoints The endpoints of X-chromosomal deletions in patients with the classical phenotype of cfibroideremia  was performed  by Southern blotting and PCR using the probes and  microsatellite  markers  given  in Figure  1. Most  of these  probes  have been described  in  the  report  of  the  committee  on  the  genetic  constitution  of  the X chromosome  (30). Sequence tagged  site (STS) markers were designed  for  PCR amplification  of  probes  pJ7.6A  (5'-GCTCCCAGTCTTTTCTGGCT-3'  and 5'-TGTGGGGGAATCATTCAGGAA-3>)  and  pJ7.6B  (5'ATTGCACCC- AGTTAAAATGGCT-3' and 5'-ACTGATTTCCTTACTTCTGGGT-3').  These primers  were  used  as  described  for  the  PCR-SSCP  analysis  at  an  annealing temperature  of  59C.  DNA  sequencing The sequence of intron-exon boundaries was determined from genomic  fragments of the CHM gene that were contained in plasmid Bluescript (stratagene). Double- stranded  DNA  was  sequenced  by  using  the  T3,  T7,  KS  and  SK  primers  in conjunction  with  the  Pharmacia  T7  sequencing  kit.  Mutation  screening PCR-single strand conformation  polymorphism  (SSCP) analysis was  performed according  to  the  method  of  Orita  et  al.  (31),  with  slight  modifications. Oligonucleotides  used  for  genomic  PCR  amplification  of  the  CHM  exons  are listed  in Table  1  In most  PCR  reactions  32P  end-labeled  primers  were used as described by van den Hurk a  al. (12). Occasionally, PCR reactions were performed in the presence of 32P-dCTP and non-radioactive primers (32). PCR was for 30 cycles  with  each  cycle  for  1 min  at  94C,  1 min  at  5C  below  the  calculated (, of the oligonucleotide (Table  1) and  1.5  min at 72C. Samples of the reaction mixture were denatured and applied to a 6% non-denaturing  polyacrylarrude gel (12).  PCR  fragments  with  an  altered  electrophoretic  mobility  were  directly sequenced  by  using  the  cycle  sequencing  protocol  (33).
